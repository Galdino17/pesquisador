GÊNESIS
 GÊNESIS 1
#Gn1-1: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
#Gn1-2: Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. 
#Gn1-3: And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 
#Gn1-4: God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 
#Gn1-5: God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning —the first day. 
#Gn1-6: And God said, "Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water." 
#Gn1-7: So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 
#Gn1-8: God called the vault "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning —the second day. 
#Gn1-9: And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so. 
#Gn1-10: God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good. 
#Gn1-11: Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so. 
#Gn1-12: The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 
#Gn1-13: And there was evening, and there was morning —the third day. 
#Gn1-14: And God said, "Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 
#Gn1-15: and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so. 
#Gn1-16: God made two great lights —the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 
#Gn1-17: God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 
#Gn1-18: to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
#Gn1-19: And there was evening, and there was morning —the fourth day. 
#Gn1-20: And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky." 
#Gn1-21: So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 
#Gn1-22: God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth." 
#Gn1-23: And there was evening, and there was morning —the fifth day. 
#Gn1-24: And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so. 
#Gn1-25: God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 
#Gn1-26: Then God said, "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, "and over all the creatures that move along the ground." 
#Gn1-27: So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. 
#Gn1-28: God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground." 
#Gn1-29: Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 
#Gn1-30: And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground —everything that has the breath of life in it —I give every green plant for food." And it was so. 
#Gn1-31: God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning —the sixth day.
 GÊNESIS 2
#Gn2-1: Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. 
#Gn2-2: By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 
#Gn2-3: Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. 
#Gn2-4: This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the LORD God made the earth and the heavens. 
#Gn2-5: Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth "and no plant had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, 
#Gn2-6: but streams "came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. 
#Gn2-7: Then the LORD God formed a man "from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. 
#Gn2-8: Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. 
#Gn2-9: The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground —trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 
#Gn2-10: A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. 
#Gn2-11: The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
#Gn2-12: (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin "and onyx are also there.) 
#Gn2-13: The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. [^5] 
#Gn2-14: The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. 
#Gn2-15: The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 
#Gn2-16: And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 
#Gn2-17: but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die." 
#Gn2-18: The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him." 
#Gn2-19: Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 
#Gn2-20: So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam "no suitable helper was found. 
#Gn2-21: So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs "and then closed up the place with flesh. 
#Gn2-22: Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib "he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. 
#Gn2-23: The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man." 
#Gn2-24: That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. 
#Gn2-25: Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
 GÊNESIS 3
#Gn3-1: Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?" 
#Gn3-2: The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, 
#Gn3-3: but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'" 
#Gn3-4: "You will not certainly die," the serpent said to the woman. 
#Gn3-5: "For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." 
#Gn3-6: When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 
#Gn3-7: Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. 
#Gn3-8: Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. 
#Gn3-9: But the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?" 
#Gn3-10: He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid." 
#Gn3-11: And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?" 
#Gn3-12: The man said, "The woman you put here with me —she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it." 
#Gn3-13: Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate." 
#Gn3-14: So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, "Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. 
#Gn3-15: And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring "and hers; he will crush "your head, and you will strike his heel." 
#Gn3-16: To the woman he said, "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you." 
#Gn3-17: To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life. 
#Gn3-18: It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. 
#Gn3-19: By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return." 
#Gn3-20: Adam "named his wife Eve, "because she would become the mother of all the living. 
#Gn3-21: The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. 
#Gn3-22: And the LORD God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever." 
#Gn3-23: So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. 
#Gn3-24: After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side "of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
 GÊNESIS 4
#Gn4-1: Adam "made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. "She said, "With the help of the LORD I have brought forth "a man." 
#Gn4-2: Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. 
#Gn4-3: In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. 
#Gn4-4: And Abel also brought an offering —fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, 
#Gn4-5: but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. 
#Gn4-6: Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? 
#Gn4-7: If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it." 
#Gn4-8: Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." "While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. 
#Gn4-9: Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?" 
#Gn4-10: The LORD said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. 
#Gn4-11: Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 
#Gn4-12: When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth." 
#Gn4-13: Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear. 
#Gn4-14: Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me." 
#Gn4-15: But the LORD said to him, "Not so "; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. 
#Gn4-16: So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, "east of Eden. 
#Gn4-17: Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 
#Gn4-18: To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. 
#Gn4-19: Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. 
#Gn4-20: Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. 
#Gn4-21: His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. 
#Gn4-22: Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of "bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah. 
#Gn4-23: Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. 
#Gn4-24: If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times." 
#Gn4-25: Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, "saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him." 
#Gn4-26: Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on "the name of the LORD.
 GÊNESIS 5

#Gn5-2: He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them "Mankind" "when they were created. 
#Gn5-3: When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.

 GÊNESIS 6
#Gn6-1: When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, 
#Gn6-2: the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. 
#Gn6-3: Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not contend with "humans forever, for they are mortal "; their days will be a hundred and twenty years." 
#Gn6-4: The Nephilim were on the earth in those days —and also afterward —when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. 
#Gn6-5: The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. 
#Gn6-6: The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. 
#Gn6-7: So the LORD said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created —and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground —for I regret that I have made them." 
#Gn6-8: But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. 
#Gn6-9: This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. 
#Gn6-10: Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. 
#Gn6-11: Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. 
#Gn6-12: God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. 
#Gn6-13: So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. 
#Gn6-14: So make yourself an ark of cypress "wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. 
#Gn6-15: This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high. [^4] 
#Gn6-16: Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit "high all around. "Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. 
#Gn6-17: I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. 
#Gn6-18: But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark —you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. 
#Gn6-19: You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. 
#Gn6-20: Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. 
#Gn6-21: You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them." 
#Gn6-22: Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
 GÊNESIS 7
#Gn7-1: The LORD then said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. 
#Gn7-2: Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, 
#Gn7-3: and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth. 
#Gn7-4: Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made." 
#Gn7-5: And Noah did all that the LORD commanded him. 
#Gn7-6: Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth. 
#Gn7-7: And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. 
#Gn7-8: Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, 
#Gn7-9: male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah. 
#Gn7-10: And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth. 
#Gn7-11: In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of the second month —on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. 
#Gn7-12: And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. 
#Gn7-13: On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark. 
#Gn7-14: They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings. 
#Gn7-15: Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark. 
#Gn7-16: The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in. 
#Gn7-17: For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. 
#Gn7-18: The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. 
#Gn7-19: They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. 
#Gn7-20: The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits. "[^2] 
#Gn7-21: Every living thing that moved on land perished —birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. 
#Gn7-22: Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. 
#Gn7-23: Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark. 
#Gn7-24: The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
 GÊNESIS 8
#Gn8-1: But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded. 
#Gn8-2: Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky. 
#Gn8-3: The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, 
#Gn8-4: and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 
#Gn8-5: The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible. 
#Gn8-6: After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark 
#Gn8-7: and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. 
#Gn8-8: Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. 
#Gn8-9: But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. 
#Gn8-10: He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. 
#Gn8-11: When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. 
#Gn8-12: He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him. 
#Gn8-13: By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. 
#Gn8-14: By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry. 
#Gn8-15: Then God said to Noah, 
#Gn8-16: "Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives. 
#Gn8-17: Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you —the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground —so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it." 
#Gn8-18: So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives. 
#Gn8-19: All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds —everything that moves on land —came out of the ark, one kind after another. 
#Gn8-20: Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it. 
#Gn8-21: The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: "Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though "every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. 
#Gn8-22: "As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease."
 GÊNESIS 9
#Gn9-1: Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. 
#Gn9-2: The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. 
#Gn9-3: Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. 
#Gn9-4: "But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it. 
#Gn9-5: And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being. 
#Gn9-6: "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind. 
#Gn9-7: As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it." 
#Gn9-8: Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 
#Gn9-9: "I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you 
#Gn9-10: and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth. 
#Gn9-11: I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth." 
#Gn9-12: And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: 
#Gn9-13: I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.

#Gn9-27: May God extend Japheth’s[b] territory; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth."

#Gn11-2: As people moved eastward, "they found a plain in Shinar "and settled there. 
#Gn11-3: They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. 
#Gn11-4: Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth." 
#Gn11-5: But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. 
#Gn11-6: The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 
#Gn11-7: Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other." 
#Gn11-8: So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. 
#Gn11-9: That is why it was called Babel "—because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth. 
#Gn11-10: This is the account of Shem's family line. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father "of Arphaxad.

#Gn12-12: When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live. 
#Gn12-13: Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you."

#Gn12-20: Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.

#Gn13-3: From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier

#Gn13-5: Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 
#Gn13-6: But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.

#Gn13-8: So Abram said to Lot, "Let's not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives. 
#Gn13-9: Is not the whole land before you? Let's part company. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right; if you go to the right, I'll go to the left." 
#Gn13-10: Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 
#Gn13-11: So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company: 
#Gn13-12: Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom. 
#Gn13-13: Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD. 
#Gn13-14: The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, "Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west. 
#Gn13-15: All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring "forever. 
#Gn13-16: I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. 
#Gn13-17: Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you." 
#Gn13-18: So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the LORD.

#Gn14-1: At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar, "Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim, 
#Gn14-2: these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 
#Gn14-3: All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley). 
#Gn14-4: For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
#Gn14-5: In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim 
#Gn14-6: and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert. 
#Gn14-7: Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar. 
#Gn14-8: Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim 
#Gn14-9: against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar —four kings against five. 
#Gn14-10: Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills. 
#Gn14-11: The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away. 
#Gn14-12: They also carried off Abram's nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom. 
#Gn14-13: A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother "of Eshkol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram. 
#Gn14-14: When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 
#Gn14-15: During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus. 
#Gn14-16: He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people. 
#Gn14-17: After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley). 
#Gn14-18: Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, 
#Gn14-19: and he blessed Abram, saying, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. 
#Gn14-20: And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand." Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything. 
#Gn14-21: The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself." 
#Gn14-22: But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, 
#Gn14-23: that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, 'I made Abram rich.' 
#Gn14-24: I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me —to Aner, Eshkol and Mamre. Let them have their share."
 GÊNESIS 15
#Gn15-1: After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, "your very great reward. "" 
#Gn15-2: But Abram said, "Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit "my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?" 
#Gn15-3: And Abram said, "You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir." 
#Gn15-4: Then the word of the LORD came to him: "This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir." 
#Gn15-5: He took him outside and said, "Look up at the sky and count the stars —if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring "be." 
#Gn15-6: Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness. 
#Gn15-7: He also said to him, "I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it." 
#Gn15-8: But Abram said, "Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?" 
#Gn15-9: So the LORD said to him, "Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon." 
#Gn15-10: Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. 
#Gn15-11: Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 
#Gn15-12: As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. 
#Gn15-13: Then the LORD said to him, "Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. 
#Gn15-14: But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. 
#Gn15-15: You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. 
#Gn15-16: In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure." 
#Gn15-17: When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. 
#Gn15-18: On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi "of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates — 
#Gn15-19: the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 
#Gn15-20: Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 
#Gn15-21: Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites."
 GÊNESIS 16
#Gn16-1: Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; 
#Gn16-2: so she said to Abram, "The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said. 
#Gn16-3: So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. 
#Gn16-4: He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. 
#Gn16-5: Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me." 
#Gn16-6: "Your slave is in your hands," Abram said. "Do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her. 
#Gn16-7: The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. 
#Gn16-8: And he said, "Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I’m running away from my mistress Sarai," she answered. 
#Gn16-9: Then the angel of the Lord told her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her." 
#Gn16-10: The angel added, "I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count." 
#Gn16-11: The angel of the Lord also said to her: "You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard of your misery. 
#Gn16-12: He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers." 
#Gn16-13: She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen the One who sees me." 
#Gn16-14: That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi[d]; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered. 
#Gn16-15: So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. 16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
 GÊNESIS 17
#Gn17-1: When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am God Almighty "; walk before me faithfully and be blameless. 
#Gn17-2: Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers." 
#Gn17-3: Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, 
#Gn17-4: "As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. 
#Gn17-5: No longer will you be called Abram "; your name will be Abraham, "for I have made you a father of many nations. 
#Gn17-6: I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. 
#Gn17-7: I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. 
#Gn17-8: The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God." 
#Gn17-9: Then God said to Abraham, "As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come. 
#Gn17-10: This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 
#Gn17-11: You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. 
#Gn17-12: For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner —those who are not your offspring. 
#Gn17-13: Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant. 
#Gn17-14: Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant." 
#Gn17-15: God also said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. 
#Gn17-16: I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her." 
#Gn17-17: Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, "Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?" 
#Gn17-18: And Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!" 
#Gn17-19: Then God said, "Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. "I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 
#Gn17-20: And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 
#Gn17-21: But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year." 
#Gn17-22: When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him. 
#Gn17-23: On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him. 
#Gn17-24: Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, 
#Gn17-25: and his son Ishmael was thirteen; 
#Gn17-26: Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that very day. 
#Gn17-27: And every male in Abraham's household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.
 GÊNESIS 18
#Gn18-1: The LORD appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day. 
#Gn18-2: Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. 
#Gn18-3: He said, "If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, "do not pass your servant by. 
#Gn18-4: Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. 
#Gn18-5: Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way —now that you have come to your servant." "Very well," they answered, "do as you say." 
#Gn18-6: So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. "Quick," he said, "get three seahs "of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread." 
#Gn18-7: Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. 
#Gn18-8: He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree. 
#Gn18-9: "Where is your wife Sarah?" they asked him. "There, in the tent," he said. 
#Gn18-10: Then one of them said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son." Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. 
#Gn18-11: Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. 
#Gn18-12: So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, "After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?" 
#Gn18-13: Then the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?' 
#Gn18-14: Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son." 
#Gn18-15: Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, "I did not laugh." But he said, "Yes, you did laugh." 
#Gn18-16: When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. 
#Gn18-17: Then the LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? 
#Gn18-18: Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. [^3] 
#Gn18-19: For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him." 
#Gn18-20: Then the LORD said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous 
#Gn18-21: that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know." 
#Gn18-22: The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. [^4] 
#Gn18-23: Then Abraham approached him and said: "Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
#Gn18-24: What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare "the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? 
#Gn18-25: Far be it from you to do such a thing —to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" 
#Gn18-26: The LORD said, "If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake." 
#Gn18-27: Then Abraham spoke up again: "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, 
#Gn18-28: what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?" "If I find forty-five there," he said, "I will not destroy it." 
#Gn18-29: Once again he spoke to him, "What if only forty are found there?" He said, "For the sake of forty, I will not do it." 
#Gn18-30: Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?" He answered, "I will not do it if I find thirty there." 
#Gn18-31: Abraham said, "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?" He said, "For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it." 
#Gn18-32: Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?" He answered, "For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it." 
#Gn18-33: When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.
 GÊNESIS 19
#Gn19-1: The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. 
#Gn19-2: "My lords," he said, "please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning." "No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square." 
#Gn19-3: But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. 
#Gn19-4: Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom —both young and old —surrounded the house. 
#Gn19-5: They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them." 
#Gn19-6: Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him 
#Gn19-7: and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. 
#Gn19-8: Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof." 
#Gn19-9: "Get out of our way," they replied. "This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. 
#Gn19-10: But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. 
#Gn19-11: Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. 
#Gn19-12: The two men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here —sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, 
#Gn19-13: because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it." 
#Gn19-14: So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry "his daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. 
#Gn19-15: With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished." 
#Gn19-16: When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them. 
#Gn19-17: As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, "Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!" 
#Gn19-18: But Lot said to them, "No, my lords, "please! 
#Gn19-19: Your "servant has found favor in your "eyes, and you "have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die. 
#Gn19-20: Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it —it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared." 
#Gn19-21: He said to him, "Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. 
#Gn19-22: But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it." (That is why the town was called Zoar. ") 
#Gn19-23: By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. 
#Gn19-24: Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah —from the LORD out of the heavens. 
#Gn19-25: Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities —and also the vegetation in the land. 
#Gn19-26: But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. 
#Gn19-27: Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. 
#Gn19-28: He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. 
#Gn19-29: So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. 
#Gn19-30: Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. 
#Gn19-31: One day the older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children —as is the custom all over the earth. 
#Gn19-32: Let's get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father." 
#Gn19-33: That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. 
#Gn19-34: The next day the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I slept with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father." 
#Gn19-35: So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. 
#Gn19-36: So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. 
#Gn19-37: The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab "; he is the father of the Moabites of today. 
#Gn19-38: The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi "; he is the father of the Ammonites "of today.
 GÊNESIS 20
#Gn20-1: Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar, 
#Gn20-2: and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." Then Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. 
#Gn20-3: But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman." 
#Gn20-4: Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? 
#Gn20-5: Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands." 
#Gn20-6: Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. 
#Gn20-7: Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die." 
#Gn20-8: Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid. 
#Gn20-9: Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done." 
#Gn20-10: And Abimelek asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?" 
#Gn20-11: Abraham replied, "I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.' 
#Gn20-12: Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. 
#Gn20-13: And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'" 
#Gn20-14: Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him. 
#Gn20-15: And Abimelek said, "My land is before you; live wherever you like." 
#Gn20-16: To Sarah he said, "I am giving your brother a thousand shekels "of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated." 
#Gn20-17: Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again, 
#Gn20-18: for the LORD had kept all the women in Abimelek's household from conceiving because of Abraham's wife Sarah.
 GÊNESIS 21
#Gn21-1: Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had promised. 
#Gn21-2: Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. 
#Gn21-3: Abraham gave the name Isaac "to the son Sarah bore him. 
#Gn21-4: When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him. 
#Gn21-5: Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. 
#Gn21-6: Sarah said, "God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me." 
#Gn21-7: And she added, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age." 
#Gn21-8: The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast. 
#Gn21-9: But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking, 
#Gn21-10: and she said to Abraham, "Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac." 
#Gn21-11: The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son. 
#Gn21-12: But God said to him, "Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring "will be reckoned. 
#Gn21-13: I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring." 
#Gn21-14: Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba. 
#Gn21-15: When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. 
#Gn21-16: Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, "I cannot watch the boy die." And as she sat there, she "began to sob. 
#Gn21-17: God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. 
#Gn21-18: Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation." 
#Gn21-19: Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. 
#Gn21-20: God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer. 
#Gn21-21: While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt. 
#Gn21-22: At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do. 
#Gn21-23: Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you." 
#Gn21-24: Abraham said, "I swear it." 
#Gn21-25: Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek's servants had seized. 
#Gn21-26: But Abimelek said, "I don't know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today." 
#Gn21-27: So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty. 
#Gn21-28: Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock, 
#Gn21-29: and Abimelek asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?" 
#Gn21-30: He replied, "Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well." 
#Gn21-31: So that place was called Beersheba, "because the two men swore an oath there. 
#Gn21-32: After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines. 
#Gn21-33: Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Eternal God. 
#Gn21-34: And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
 GÊNESIS 22
#Gn22-1: Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied. 
#Gn22-2: Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, whom you love —Isaac —and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you." 
#Gn22-3: Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about. 
#Gn22-4: On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 
#Gn22-5: He said to his servants, "Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you." 
#Gn22-6: Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, 
#Gn22-7: Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?" "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. "The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" 
#Gn22-8: Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together. 
#Gn22-9: When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 
#Gn22-10: Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 
#Gn22-11: But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied. 
#Gn22-12: "Do not lay a hand on the boy," he said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son." 
#Gn22-13: Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram "caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. 
#Gn22-14: So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided." 
#Gn22-15: The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time 
#Gn22-16: and said, "I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, 
#Gn22-17: I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, 
#Gn22-18: and through your offspring "all nations on earth will be blessed, "because you have obeyed me." 
#Gn22-19: Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba. 
#Gn22-20: Some time later Abraham was told, "Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor: 
#Gn22-21: Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram), 
#Gn22-22: Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel." 
#Gn22-23: Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham's brother Nahor. 
#Gn22-24: His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah.
 GÊNESIS 23
#Gn23-1: Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old. 
#Gn23-2: She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her. 
#Gn23-3: Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. "He said, 
#Gn23-4: "I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead." 
#Gn23-5: The Hittites replied to Abraham, 
#Gn23-6: "Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead." 
#Gn23-7: Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. 
#Gn23-8: He said to them, "If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf 
#Gn23-9: so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you." 
#Gn23-10: Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. 
#Gn23-11: "No, my lord," he said. "Listen to me; I give "you the field, and I give "you the cave that is in it. I give "it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead." 
#Gn23-12: Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land 
#Gn23-13: and he said to Ephron in their hearing, "Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there." 
#Gn23-14: Ephron answered Abraham, 
#Gn23-15: "Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels "of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead." 
#Gn23-16: Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants. 
#Gn23-17: So Ephron's field in Machpelah near Mamre —both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field —was deeded 
#Gn23-18: to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city. 
#Gn23-19: Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 
#Gn23-20: So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.
 GÊNESIS 24
#Gn24-1: Abraham was now very old, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. 
#Gn24-2: He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh. 
#Gn24-3: I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, 
#Gn24-4: but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac." 
#Gn24-5: The servant asked him, "What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?" 
#Gn24-6: "Make sure that you do not take my son back there," Abraham said. 
#Gn24-7: "The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring "I will give this land' —he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. 
#Gn24-8: If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there." 
#Gn24-9: So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. 
#Gn24-10: Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master's camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim "and made his way to the town of Nahor. 
#Gn24-11: He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water. 
#Gn24-12: Then he prayed, "LORD, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. 
#Gn24-13: See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. 
#Gn24-14: May it be that when I say to a young woman, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too' —let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master." 
#Gn24-15: Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor. 
#Gn24-16: The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again. 
#Gn24-17: The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar." 
#Gn24-18: "Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink. 
#Gn24-19: After she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink." 
#Gn24-20: So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. 
#Gn24-21: Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful. 
#Gn24-22: When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka "and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels. [^4] 
#Gn24-23: Then he asked, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?" 
#Gn24-24: She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor." 
#Gn24-25: And she added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night." 
#Gn24-26: Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, 
#Gn24-27: saying, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives." 
#Gn24-28: The young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things. 
#Gn24-29: Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring. 
#Gn24-30: As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. 
#Gn24-31: "Come, you who are blessed by the LORD," he said. "Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels." 
#Gn24-32: So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. 
#Gn24-33: Then food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say." "Then tell us," Laban said. 
#Gn24-34: So he said, "I am Abraham's servant. 
#Gn24-35: The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys. 
#Gn24-36: My master's wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. 
#Gn24-37: And my master made me swear an oath, and said, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, 
#Gn24-38: but go to my father's family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.' 
#Gn24-39: "Then I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?' 
#Gn24-40: "He replied, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father's family. 
#Gn24-41: You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you —then you will be released from my oath.' 
#Gn24-42: "When I came to the spring today, I said, 'LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come. 
#Gn24-43: See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar," 
#Gn24-44: and if she says to me, "Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels too," let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master's son.' 
#Gn24-45: "Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.' 
#Gn24-46: "She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also. 
#Gn24-47: "I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' "She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.' "Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, 
#Gn24-48: and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son. 
#Gn24-49: Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn." 
#Gn24-50: Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other. 
#Gn24-51: Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed." 
#Gn24-52: When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. 
#Gn24-53: Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. 
#Gn24-54: Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, "Send me on my way to my master." 
#Gn24-55: But her brother and her mother replied, "Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you "may go." 
#Gn24-56: But he said to them, "Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master." 
#Gn24-57: Then they said, "Let's call the young woman and ask her about it." 
#Gn24-58: So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Will you go with this man?" "I will go," she said. 
#Gn24-59: So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men. 
#Gn24-60: And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies." 
#Gn24-61: Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left. 
#Gn24-62: Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev. 
#Gn24-63: He went out to the field one evening to meditate, "and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching. 
#Gn24-64: Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel 
#Gn24-65: and asked the servant, "Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?" "He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. 
#Gn24-66: Then the servant told Isaac all he had done. 
#Gn24-67: Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

#Gn25-19: This is the account of the family line of Abraham's son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac, 
#Gn25-20: and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram "and sister of Laban the Aramean. 
#Gn25-21: Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. 
#Gn25-22: The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD. 
#Gn25-23: The LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger." 
#Gn25-24: When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. 
#Gn25-25: The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau. [^4] 
#Gn25-26: After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. "Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them. 
#Gn25-27: The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents. 
#Gn25-28: Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
#Gn25-29: Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished. 
#Gn25-30: He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!" (That is why he was also called Edom. ") 
#Gn25-31: Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright." 
#Gn25-32: "Look, I am about to die," Esau said. "What good is the birthright to me?" 
#Gn25-33: But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob. 
#Gn25-34: Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.
 GÊNESIS 26
#Gn26-1: Now there was a famine in the land —besides the previous famine in Abraham's time —and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar. 
#Gn26-2: The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live. 
#Gn26-3: Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham. 
#Gn26-4: I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring "all nations on earth will be blessed, [^2] 
#Gn26-5: because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions." 
#Gn26-6: So Isaac stayed in Gerar. 
#Gn26-7: When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful." 
#Gn26-8: When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. 
#Gn26-9: So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, "She is really your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac answered him, "Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her." 
#Gn26-10: Then Abimelek said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us." 
#Gn26-11: So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: "Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death." 
#Gn26-12: Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him. 
#Gn26-13: The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy. 
#Gn26-14: He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. 
#Gn26-15: So all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth. 
#Gn26-16: Then Abimelek said to Isaac, "Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us." 
#Gn26-17: So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled. 
#Gn26-18: Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them. 
#Gn26-19: Isaac's servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there. 
#Gn26-20: But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, "because they disputed with him. 
#Gn26-21: Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah. [^4] 
#Gn26-22: He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, "saying, "Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land." 
#Gn26-23: From there he went up to Beersheba. 
#Gn26-24: That night the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham." 
#Gn26-25: Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well. 
#Gn26-26: Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces. 
#Gn26-27: Isaac asked them, "Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?" 
#Gn26-28: They answered, "We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said, 'There ought to be a sworn agreement between us' —between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you 
#Gn26-29: that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the LORD." 
#Gn26-30: Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank. 
#Gn26-31: Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully. 
#Gn26-32: That day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, "We've found water!" 
#Gn26-33: He called it Shibah, "and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba. [^7] 
#Gn26-34: When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
#Gn26-35: They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
 GÊNESIS 27
#Gn27-1: When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, "My son." "Here I am," he answered. 
#Gn27-2: Isaac said, "I am now an old man and don't know the day of my death. 
#Gn27-3: Now then, get your equipment —your quiver and bow —and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. 
#Gn27-4: Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die." 
#Gn27-5: Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, 
#Gn27-6: Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, 
#Gn27-7: 'Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.' 
#Gn27-8: Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: 
#Gn27-9: Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. 
#Gn27-10: Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies." 
#Gn27-11: Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin. 
#Gn27-12: What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing." 
#Gn27-13: His mother said to him, "My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me." 
#Gn27-14: So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. 
#Gn27-15: Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 
#Gn27-16: She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. 
#Gn27-17: Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made. 
#Gn27-18: He went to his father and said, "My father." "Yes, my son," he answered. "Who is it?" 
#Gn27-19: Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing." 
#Gn27-20: Isaac asked his son, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?" "The LORD your God gave me success," he replied. 
#Gn27-21: Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not." 
#Gn27-22: Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau." 
#Gn27-23: He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him. 
#Gn27-24: "Are you really my son Esau?" he asked. "I am," he replied. 
#Gn27-25: Then he said, "My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing." Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. 
#Gn27-26: Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come here, my son, and kiss me." 
#Gn27-27: So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed. 
#Gn27-28: May God give you heaven's dew and earth's richness — an abundance of grain and new wine. 
#Gn27-29: May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed." 
#Gn27-30: After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting. 
#Gn27-31: He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, "My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing." 
#Gn27-32: His father Isaac asked him, "Who are you?" "I am your son," he answered, "your firstborn, Esau." 
#Gn27-33: Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him —and indeed he will be blessed!" 
#Gn27-34: When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me —me too, my father!" 
#Gn27-35: But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing." 
#Gn27-36: Esau said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob "? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!" Then he asked, "Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?" 
#Gn27-37: Isaac answered Esau, "I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?" 
#Gn27-38: Esau said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!" Then Esau wept aloud. 
#Gn27-39: His father Isaac answered him, "Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness, away from the dew of heaven above. 
#Gn27-40: You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck." 
#Gn27-41: Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob." 
#Gn27-42: When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you. 
#Gn27-43: Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran. 
#Gn27-44: Stay with him for a while until your brother's fury subsides. 
#Gn27-45: When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I'll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?" 
#Gn27-46: Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living."
 GÊNESIS 28
#Gn28-1: So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: "Do not marry a Canaanite woman. 
#Gn28-2: Go at once to Paddan Aram, "to the house of your mother's father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother. 
#Gn28-3: May God Almighty "bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples. 
#Gn28-4: May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham." 
#Gn28-5: Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau. 
#Gn28-6: Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, "Do not marry a Canaanite woman," 
#Gn28-7: and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram. 
#Gn28-8: Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac; 
#Gn28-9: so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had. 
#Gn28-10: Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran. 
#Gn28-11: When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. 
#Gn28-12: He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 
#Gn28-13: There above it "stood the LORD, and he said: "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. 
#Gn28-14: Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. [^4] 
#Gn28-15: I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you." 
#Gn28-16: When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it." 
#Gn28-17: He was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven." 
#Gn28-18: Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. 
#Gn28-19: He called that place Bethel, "though the city used to be called Luz. 
#Gn28-20: Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear 
#Gn28-21: so that I return safely to my father's household, then the LORD "will be my God 
#Gn28-22: and "this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth."
 GÊNESIS 29
#Gn29-1: Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples. 
#Gn29-2: There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large. 
#Gn29-3: When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well's mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well. 
#Gn29-4: Jacob asked the shepherds, "My brothers, where are you from?" "We're from Harran," they replied. 
#Gn29-5: He said to them, "Do you know Laban, Nahor's grandson?" "Yes, we know him," they answered. 
#Gn29-6: Then Jacob asked them, "Is he well?" "Yes, he is," they said, "and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep." 
#Gn29-7: "Look," he said, "the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture." 
#Gn29-8: "We can't," they replied, "until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep." 
#Gn29-9: While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherd. 
#Gn29-10: When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle's sheep. 
#Gn29-11: Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud. 
#Gn29-12: He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father. 
#Gn29-13: As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things. 
#Gn29-14: Then Laban said to him, "You are my own flesh and blood." After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month, 
#Gn29-15: Laban said to him, "Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be." 
#Gn29-16: Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
#Gn29-17: Leah had weak "eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful. 
#Gn29-18: Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, "I'll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel." 
#Gn29-19: Laban said, "It's better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me." 
#Gn29-20: So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her. 
#Gn29-21: Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to make love to her." 
#Gn29-22: So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast. 
#Gn29-23: But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob made love to her. 
#Gn29-24: And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant. 
#Gn29-25: When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me?" 
#Gn29-26: Laban replied, "It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one. 
#Gn29-27: Finish this daughter's bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work." 
#Gn29-28: And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. 
#Gn29-29: Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant. 
#Gn29-30: Jacob made love to Rachel also, and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years. 
#Gn29-31: When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless. 
#Gn29-32: Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, "for she said, "It is because the LORD has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now." 
#Gn29-33: She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "Because the LORD heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too." So she named him Simeon. [^3] 
#Gn29-34: Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." So he was named Levi. [^4] 
#Gn29-35: She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "This time I will praise the LORD." So she named him Judah. "Then she stopped having children.
 GÊNESIS 30
#Gn30-1: When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I'll die!" 
#Gn30-2: Jacob became angry with her and said, "Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?" 
#Gn30-3: Then she said, "Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her." 
#Gn30-4: So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her, 
#Gn30-5: and she became pregnant and bore him a son. 
#Gn30-6: Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son." Because of this she named him Dan. [^1] 
#Gn30-7: Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
#Gn30-8: Then Rachel said, "I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won." So she named him Naphtali. [^2] 
#Gn30-9: When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
#Gn30-10: Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
#Gn30-11: Then Leah said, "What good fortune!" "So she named him Gad. [^4] 
#Gn30-12: Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. 
#Gn30-13: Then Leah said, "How happy I am! The women will call me happy." So she named him Asher. [^5] 
#Gn30-14: During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes." 
#Gn30-15: But she said to her, "Wasn't it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son's mandrakes too?" "Very well," Rachel said, "he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes." 
#Gn30-16: So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. "You must sleep with me," she said. "I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he slept with her that night. 
#Gn30-17: God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
#Gn30-18: Then Leah said, "God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband." So she named him Issachar. [^6] 
#Gn30-19: Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. 
#Gn30-20: Then Leah said, "God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun. [^7] 
#Gn30-21: Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah. 
#Gn30-22: Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive. 
#Gn30-23: She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, "God has taken away my disgrace." 
#Gn30-24: She named him Joseph, "and said, "May the LORD add to me another son." 
#Gn30-25: After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland. 
#Gn30-26: Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I've done for you." 
#Gn30-27: But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you." 
#Gn30-28: He added, "Name your wages, and I will pay them." 
#Gn30-29: Jacob said to him, "You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care. 
#Gn30-30: The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?" 
#Gn30-31: "What shall I give you?" he asked. "Don't give me anything," Jacob replied. "But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them: 
#Gn30-32: Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages. 
#Gn30-33: And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen." 
#Gn30-34: "Agreed," said Laban. "Let it be as you have said." 
#Gn30-35: That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons. 
#Gn30-36: Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks. 
#Gn30-37: Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches. 
#Gn30-38: Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink, 
#Gn30-39: they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. 
#Gn30-40: Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban's animals. 
#Gn30-41: Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches, 
#Gn30-42: but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob. 
#Gn30-43: In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
 GÊNESIS 31
#Gn31-1: Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, "Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father." 
#Gn31-2: And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude toward him was not what it had been. 
#Gn31-3: Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you." 
#Gn31-4: So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were. 
#Gn31-5: He said to them, "I see that your father's attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me. 
#Gn31-6: You know that I've worked for your father with all my strength, 
#Gn31-7: yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me. 
#Gn31-8: If he said, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, 'The streaked ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks bore streaked young. 
#Gn31-9: So God has taken away your father's livestock and has given them to me. 
#Gn31-10: "In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted. 
#Gn31-11: The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob.' I answered, 'Here I am.' 
#Gn31-12: And he said, 'Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. 
#Gn31-13: I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.'" 
#Gn31-14: Then Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate? 
#Gn31-15: Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us. 
#Gn31-16: Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you." 
#Gn31-17: Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels, 
#Gn31-18: and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, "to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. 
#Gn31-19: When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods. 
#Gn31-20: Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away. 
#Gn31-21: So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead. 
#Gn31-22: On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled. 
#Gn31-23: Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. 
#Gn31-24: Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad." 
#Gn31-25: Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too. 
#Gn31-26: Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You've deceived me, and you've carried off my daughters like captives in war. 
#Gn31-27: Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps? 
#Gn31-28: You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing. 
#Gn31-29: I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.' 
#Gn31-30: Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father's household. But why did you steal my gods?" 
#Gn31-31: Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. 
#Gn31-32: But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods. 
#Gn31-33: So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent. 
#Gn31-34: Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. 
#Gn31-35: Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods. 
#Gn31-36: Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. "What is my crime?" he asked Laban. "How have I wronged you that you hunt me down? 
#Gn31-37: Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us. 
#Gn31-38: "I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks. 
#Gn31-39: I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night. 
#Gn31-40: This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes. 
#Gn31-41: It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times. 
#Gn31-42: If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you." 
#Gn31-43: Laban answered Jacob, "The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne? 
#Gn31-44: Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us." 
#Gn31-45: So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. 
#Gn31-46: He said to his relatives, "Gather some stones." So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap. 
#Gn31-47: Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed. [^2] 
#Gn31-48: Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed. 
#Gn31-49: It was also called Mizpah, "because he said, "May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other. 
#Gn31-50: If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me." 
#Gn31-51: Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me. 
#Gn31-52: This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me. 
#Gn31-53: May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac. 
#Gn31-54: He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there. 
#Gn31-55: Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home. [^4]
 GÊNESIS 32
#Gn32-1: Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
#Gn32-2: When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim. [^2] 
#Gn32-3: Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
#Gn32-4: He instructed them: "This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now. 
#Gn32-5: I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'" 
#Gn32-6: When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him." 
#Gn32-7: In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, "and the flocks and herds and camels as well. 
#Gn32-8: He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, "the group "that is left may escape." 
#Gn32-9: Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, LORD, you who said to me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,' 
#Gn32-10: I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps. 
#Gn32-11: Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children. 
#Gn32-12: But you have said, 'I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'" 
#Gn32-13: He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau: 
#Gn32-14: two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
#Gn32-15: thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. 
#Gn32-16: He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds." 
#Gn32-17: He instructed the one in the lead: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?' 
#Gn32-18: then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'" 
#Gn32-19: He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. 
#Gn32-20: And be sure to say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'" For he thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me." 
#Gn32-21: So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp. 
#Gn32-22: That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 
#Gn32-23: After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. 
#Gn32-24: So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. 
#Gn32-25: When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. 
#Gn32-26: Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me." 
#Gn32-27: The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered. 
#Gn32-28: Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, "because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome." 
#Gn32-29: Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there. 
#Gn32-30: So Jacob called the place Peniel, "saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared." 
#Gn32-31: The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, "and he was limping because of his hip. 
#Gn32-32: Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.
 GÊNESIS 33
#Gn33-1: Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants. 
#Gn33-2: He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. 
#Gn33-3: He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. 
#Gn33-4: But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept. 
#Gn33-5: Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked. Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant." 
#Gn33-6: Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down. 
#Gn33-7: Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down. 
#Gn33-8: Esau asked, "What's the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?" "To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said. 
#Gn33-9: But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself." 
#Gn33-10: "No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably. 
#Gn33-11: Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it. 
#Gn33-12: Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you." 
#Gn33-13: But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die. 
#Gn33-14: So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir." 
#Gn33-15: Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." "But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord." 
#Gn33-16: So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir. 
#Gn33-17: Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth. [^1] 
#Gn33-18: After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, "he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city. 
#Gn33-19: For a hundred pieces of silver, "he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent. 
#Gn33-20: There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel. [^4]
 GÊNESIS 34
#Gn34-1: Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land. 
#Gn34-2: When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her. 
#Gn34-3: His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her. 
#Gn34-4: And Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl as my wife." 
#Gn34-5: When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home. 
#Gn34-6: Then Shechem's father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob. 
#Gn34-7: Meanwhile, Jacob's sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious, because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in "Israel by sleeping with Jacob's daughter —a thing that should not be done. 
#Gn34-8: But Hamor said to them, "My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. 
#Gn34-9: Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves. 
#Gn34-10: You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade "in it, and acquire property in it." 
#Gn34-11: Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask. 
#Gn34-12: Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I'll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife." 
#Gn34-13: Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob's sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor. 
#Gn34-14: They said to them, "We can't do such a thing; we can't give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us. 
#Gn34-15: We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males. 
#Gn34-16: Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We'll settle among you and become one people with you. 
#Gn34-17: But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we'll take our sister and go." 
#Gn34-18: Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. 
#Gn34-19: The young man, who was the most honored of all his father's family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. 
#Gn34-20: So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city. 
#Gn34-21: "These men are friendly toward us," they said. "Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours. 
#Gn34-22: But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are. 
#Gn34-23: Won't their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us." 
#Gn34-24: All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised. 
#Gn34-25: Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. 
#Gn34-26: They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. 
#Gn34-27: The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where "their sister had been defiled. 
#Gn34-28: They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields. 
#Gn34-29: They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses. 
#Gn34-30: Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed." 
#Gn34-31: But they replied, "Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?"
 GÊNESIS 35
#Gn35-1: Then God said to Jacob, "Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau." 
#Gn35-2: So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes. 
#Gn35-3: Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone." 
#Gn35-4: So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem. 
#Gn35-5: Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them. 
#Gn35-6: Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. 
#Gn35-7: There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, "because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. 
#Gn35-8: Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth. [^2] 
#Gn35-9: After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, "God appeared to him again and blessed him. 
#Gn35-10: God said to him, "Your name is Jacob, "but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel. "" So he named him Israel. 
#Gn35-11: And God said to him, "I am God Almighty "; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants. 
#Gn35-12: The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you." 
#Gn35-13: Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him. 
#Gn35-14: Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. 
#Gn35-15: Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel. [^7] 
#Gn35-16: Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty. 
#Gn35-17: And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, "Don't despair, for you have another son." 
#Gn35-18: As she breathed her last —for she was dying —she named her son Ben-Oni. "But his father named him Benjamin. [^9] 
#Gn35-19: So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
#Gn35-20: Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel's tomb. 
#Gn35-21: Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder. 
#Gn35-22: While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons: 
#Gn35-23: The sons of Leah: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. 
#Gn35-24: The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
#Gn35-25: The sons of Rachel's servant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali. 
#Gn35-26: The sons of Leah's servant Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. 
#Gn35-27: Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. 
#Gn35-28: Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years. 
#Gn35-29: Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
 GÊNESIS 36
#Gn36-1: This is the account of the family line of Esau (that is, Edom).

 GÊNESIS 37
#Gn37-1: Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. 
#Gn37-2: This is the account of Jacob's family line. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them. 
#Gn37-3: Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate "robe for him. 
#Gn37-4: When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. 
#Gn37-5: Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. 
#Gn37-6: He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had: 
#Gn37-7: We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it." 
#Gn37-8: His brothers said to him, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said. 
#Gn37-9: Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me." 
#Gn37-10: When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?" 
#Gn37-11: His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. 
#Gn37-12: Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem, 
#Gn37-13: and Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them." "Very well," he replied. 
#Gn37-14: So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem, 
#Gn37-15: a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?" 
#Gn37-16: He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?" 
#Gn37-17: "They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. 
#Gn37-18: But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him. 
#Gn37-19: "Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other. 
#Gn37-20: "Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams." 
#Gn37-21: When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said. 
#Gn37-22: "Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don't lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father. 
#Gn37-23: So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe —the ornate robe he was wearing — 
#Gn37-24: and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it. 
#Gn37-25: As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt. 
#Gn37-26: Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 
#Gn37-27: Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed. 
#Gn37-28: So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels "of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. 
#Gn37-29: When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. 
#Gn37-30: He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?" 
#Gn37-31: Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. 
#Gn37-32: They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe." 
#Gn37-33: He recognized it and said, "It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces." 
#Gn37-34: Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. 
#Gn37-35: All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave." So his father wept for him. 
#Gn37-36: Meanwhile, the Midianites "sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.
 GÊNESIS 38
#Gn38-1: At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah. 
#Gn38-2: There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her; 
#Gn38-3: she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er. 
#Gn38-4: She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. 
#Gn38-5: She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him. 
#Gn38-6: Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
#Gn38-7: But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to death. 
#Gn38-8: Then Judah said to Onan, "Sleep with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother." 
#Gn38-9: But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother. 
#Gn38-10: What he did was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to death also. 
#Gn38-11: Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's household until my son Shelah grows up." For he thought, "He may die too, just like his brothers." So Tamar went to live in her father's household. 
#Gn38-12: After a long time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him. 
#Gn38-13: When Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep," 
#Gn38-14: she took off her widow's clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife. 
#Gn38-15: When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 
#Gn38-16: Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, "Come now, let me sleep with you." "And what will you give me to sleep with you?" she asked. 
#Gn38-17: "I'll send you a young goat from my flock," he said. "Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?" she asked. 
#Gn38-18: He said, "What pledge should I give you?" "Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand," she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. 
#Gn38-19: After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again. 
#Gn38-20: Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her. 
#Gn38-21: He asked the men who lived there, "Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?" "There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here," they said. 
#Gn38-22: So he went back to Judah and said, "I didn't find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, 'There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here.'" 
#Gn38-23: Then Judah said, "Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn't find her." 
#Gn38-24: About three months later Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant." Judah said, "Bring her out and have her burned to death!" 
#Gn38-25: As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. "I am pregnant by the man who owns these," she said. And she added, "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are." 
#Gn38-26: Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah." And he did not sleep with her again. 
#Gn38-27: When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. 
#Gn38-28: As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, "This one came out first." 
#Gn38-29: But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, "So this is how you have broken out!" And he was named Perez. [^1] 
#Gn38-30: Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out. And he was named Zerah. [^2]
 GÊNESIS 39
#Gn39-1: Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. 
#Gn39-2: The LORD was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master. 
#Gn39-3: When his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD gave him success in everything he did, 
#Gn39-4: Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned. 
#Gn39-5: From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the LORD was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field. 
#Gn39-6: So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph's care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, 
#Gn39-7: and after a while his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, "Come to bed with me!" 
#Gn39-8: But he refused. "With me in charge," he told her, "my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care. 
#Gn39-9: No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?" 
#Gn39-10: And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her. 
#Gn39-11: One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside. 
#Gn39-12: She caught him by his cloak and said, "Come to bed with me!" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house. 
#Gn39-13: When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, 
#Gn39-14: she called her household servants. "Look," she said to them, "this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed. 
#Gn39-15: When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house." 
#Gn39-16: She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home. 
#Gn39-17: Then she told him this story: "That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me. 
#Gn39-18: But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house." 
#Gn39-19: When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, "This is how your slave treated me," he burned with anger. 
#Gn39-20: Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison, 
#Gn39-21: the LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. 
#Gn39-22: So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there. 
#Gn39-23: The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.
 GÊNESIS 40
#Gn40-1: Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt. 
#Gn40-2: Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, 
#Gn40-3: and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. 
#Gn40-4: The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time, 
#Gn40-5: each of the two men —the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison —had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. 
#Gn40-6: When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected. 
#Gn40-7: So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were in custody with him in his master's house, "Why do you look so sad today?" 
#Gn40-8: "We both had dreams," they answered, "but there is no one to interpret them." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams." 
#Gn40-9: So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, "In my dream I saw a vine in front of me, 
#Gn40-10: and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. 
#Gn40-11: Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup and put the cup in his hand." 
#Gn40-12: "This is what it means," Joseph said to him. "The three branches are three days. 
#Gn40-13: Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer. 
#Gn40-14: But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison. 
#Gn40-15: I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon." 
#Gn40-16: When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, "I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread. [^1] 
#Gn40-17: In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head." 
#Gn40-18: "This is what it means," Joseph said. "The three baskets are three days. 
#Gn40-19: Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh." 
#Gn40-20: Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials: 
#Gn40-21: He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh's hand — 
#Gn40-22: but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation. 
#Gn40-23: The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
 GÊNESIS 41
#Gn41-1: When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile, 
#Gn41-2: when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds. 
#Gn41-3: After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank. 
#Gn41-4: And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. 
#Gn41-5: He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk. 
#Gn41-6: After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted —thin and scorched by the east wind. 
#Gn41-7: The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream. 
#Gn41-8: In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. 
#Gn41-9: Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "Today I am reminded of my shortcomings. 
#Gn41-10: Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard. 
#Gn41-11: Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. 
#Gn41-12: Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream. 
#Gn41-13: And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was impaled." 
#Gn41-14: So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh. 
#Gn41-15: Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it." 
#Gn41-16: "I cannot do it," Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires." 
#Gn41-17: Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
#Gn41-18: when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. 
#Gn41-19: After them, seven other cows came up —scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt. 
#Gn41-20: The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. 
#Gn41-21: But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up. 
#Gn41-22: "In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. 
#Gn41-23: After them, seven other heads sprouted —withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. 
#Gn41-24: The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me." 
#Gn41-25: Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
#Gn41-26: The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream. 
#Gn41-27: The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine. 
#Gn41-28: "It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
#Gn41-29: Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, 
#Gn41-30: but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land. 
#Gn41-31: The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe. 
#Gn41-32: The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon. 
#Gn41-33: "And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. 
#Gn41-34: Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 
#Gn41-35: They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food. 
#Gn41-36: This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine." 
#Gn41-37: The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials. 
#Gn41-38: So Pharaoh asked them, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God "?" 
#Gn41-39: Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you. 
#Gn41-40: You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you." 
#Gn41-41: So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt." 
#Gn41-42: Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. 
#Gn41-43: He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, "and people shouted before him, "Make way "!" Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. 
#Gn41-44: Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt." 
#Gn41-45: Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, "to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt. 
#Gn41-46: Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and traveled throughout Egypt. 
#Gn41-47: During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully. 
#Gn41-48: Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it. 
#Gn41-49: Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure. 
#Gn41-50: Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. 
#Gn41-51: Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh "and said, "It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household." 
#Gn41-52: The second son he named Ephraim "and said, "It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering." 
#Gn41-53: The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, 
#Gn41-54: and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food. 
#Gn41-55: When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph and do what he tells you." 
#Gn41-56: When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt. 
#Gn41-57: And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.
 GÊNESIS 42
#Gn42-1: When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you just keep looking at each other?" 
#Gn42-2: He continued, "I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die." 
#Gn42-3: Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
#Gn42-4: But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him. 
#Gn42-5: So Israel's sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also. 
#Gn42-6: Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph's brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. 
#Gn42-7: As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he asked. "From the land of Canaan," they replied, "to buy food." 
#Gn42-8: Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
#Gn42-9: Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected." 
#Gn42-10: "No, my lord," they answered. "Your servants have come to buy food. 
#Gn42-11: We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies." 
#Gn42-12: "No!" he said to them. "You have come to see where our land is unprotected." 
#Gn42-13: But they replied, "Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more." 
#Gn42-14: Joseph said to them, "It is just as I told you: You are spies! 
#Gn42-15: And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. 
#Gn42-16: Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!" 
#Gn42-17: And he put them all in custody for three days. 
#Gn42-18: On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God: 
#Gn42-19: If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households. 
#Gn42-20: But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die." This they proceeded to do. 
#Gn42-21: They said to one another, "Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that's why this distress has come on us." 
#Gn42-22: Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood." 
#Gn42-23: They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter. 
#Gn42-24: He turned away from them and began to weep, but then came back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes. 
#Gn42-25: Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man's silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them, 
#Gn42-26: they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left. 
#Gn42-27: At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack. 
#Gn42-28: "My silver has been returned," he said to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack." Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, "What is this that God has done to us?" 
#Gn42-29: When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said, 
#Gn42-30: "The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land. 
#Gn42-31: But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies. 
#Gn42-32: We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.' 
#Gn42-33: "Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, 'This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go. 
#Gn42-34: But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade "in the land.'" 
#Gn42-35: As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man's sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened. 
#Gn42-36: Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!" 
#Gn42-37: Then Reuben said to his father, "You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back." 
#Gn42-38: But Jacob said, "My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow."
 GÊNESIS 43
#Gn43-1: Now the famine was still severe in the land. 
#Gn43-2: So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us a little more food." 
#Gn43-3: But Judah said to him, "The man warned us solemnly, 'You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.' 
#Gn43-4: If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you. 
#Gn43-5: But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, 'You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'" 
#Gn43-6: Israel asked, "Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?" 
#Gn43-7: They replied, "The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. 'Is your father still living?' he asked us. 'Do you have another brother?' We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, 'Bring your brother down here'?" 
#Gn43-8: Then Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die. 
#Gn43-9: I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life. 
#Gn43-10: As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice." 
#Gn43-11: Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift —a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds. 
#Gn43-12: Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. 
#Gn43-13: Take your brother also and go back to the man at once. 
#Gn43-14: And may God Almighty "grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved." 
#Gn43-15: So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph. 
#Gn43-16: When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare a meal; they are to eat with me at noon." 
#Gn43-17: The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph's house. 
#Gn43-18: Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, "We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys." 
#Gn43-19: So they went up to Joseph's steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house. 
#Gn43-20: "We beg your pardon, our lord," they said, "we came down here the first time to buy food. 
#Gn43-21: But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver —the exact weight —in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us. 
#Gn43-22: We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don't know who put our silver in our sacks." 
#Gn43-23: "It's all right," he said. "Don't be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver." Then he brought Simeon out to them. 
#Gn43-24: The steward took the men into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys. 
#Gn43-25: They prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there. 
#Gn43-26: When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground. 
#Gn43-27: He asked them how they were, and then he said, "How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?" 
#Gn43-28: They replied, "Your servant our father is still alive and well." And they bowed down, prostrating themselves before him. 
#Gn43-29: As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, he asked, "Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?" And he said, "God be gracious to you, my son." 
#Gn43-30: Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there. 
#Gn43-31: After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, "Serve the food." 
#Gn43-32: They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians. 
#Gn43-33: The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment. 
#Gn43-34: When portions were served to them from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
 GÊNESIS 44
#Gn44-1: Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: "Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack. 
#Gn44-2: Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one's sack, along with the silver for his grain." And he did as Joseph said. 
#Gn44-3: As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. 
#Gn44-4: They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, "Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil? 
#Gn44-5: Isn't this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.'" 
#Gn44-6: When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them. 
#Gn44-7: But they said to him, "Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that! 
#Gn44-8: We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master's house? 
#Gn44-9: If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord's slaves." 
#Gn44-10: "Very well, then," he said, "let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame." 
#Gn44-11: Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. 
#Gn44-12: Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
#Gn44-13: At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city. 
#Gn44-14: Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him. 
#Gn44-15: Joseph said to them, "What is this you have done? Don't you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?" 
#Gn44-16: "What can we say to my lord?" Judah replied. "What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants' guilt. We are now my lord's slaves —we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup." 
#Gn44-17: But Joseph said, "Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace." 
#Gn44-18: Then Judah went up to him and said: "Pardon your servant, my lord, let me speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself. 
#Gn44-19: My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?' 
#Gn44-20: And we answered, 'We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother's sons left, and his father loves him.' 
#Gn44-21: "Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.' 
#Gn44-22: And we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.' 
#Gn44-23: But you told your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.' 
#Gn44-24: When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said. 
#Gn44-25: "Then our father said, 'Go back and buy a little more food.' 
#Gn44-26: But we said, 'We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.' 
#Gn44-27: "Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons. 
#Gn44-28: One of them went away from me, and I said, "He has surely been torn to pieces." And I have not seen him since. 
#Gn44-29: If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.' 
#Gn44-30: "So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy's life, 
#Gn44-31: sees that the boy isn't there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow. 
#Gn44-32: Your servant guaranteed the boy's safety to my father. I said, 'If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!' 
#Gn44-33: "Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord's slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers. 
#Gn44-34: How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father."
 GÊNESIS 45
#Gn45-1: Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, "Have everyone leave my presence!" So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers. 
#Gn45-2: And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh's household heard about it. 
#Gn45-3: Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence. 
#Gn45-4: Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come close to me." When they had done so, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! 
#Gn45-5: And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. 
#Gn45-6: For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping. 
#Gn45-7: But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. [^1] 
#Gn45-8: "So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt. 
#Gn45-9: Now hurry back to my father and say to him, 'This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don't delay. 
#Gn45-10: You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me —you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have. 
#Gn45-11: I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.' 
#Gn45-12: "You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you. 
#Gn45-13: Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly." 
#Gn45-14: Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping. 
#Gn45-15: And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him. 
#Gn45-16: When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased. 
#Gn45-17: Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan, 
#Gn45-18: and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.' 
#Gn45-19: "You are also directed to tell them, 'Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come. 
#Gn45-20: Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.'" 
#Gn45-21: So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey. 
#Gn45-22: To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels "of silver and five sets of clothes. 
#Gn45-23: And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey. 
#Gn45-24: Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, "Don't quarrel on the way!" 
#Gn45-25: So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. 
#Gn45-26: They told him, "Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt." Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them. 
#Gn45-27: But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. 
#Gn45-28: And Israel said, "I'm convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
 GÊNESIS 46
#Gn46-1: So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
#Gn46-2: And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, "Jacob! Jacob!" "Here I am," he replied. 
#Gn46-3: "I am God, the God of your father," he said. "Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. 
#Gn46-4: I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph's own hand will close your eyes." 
#Gn46-5: Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel's sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him. 
#Gn46-6: So Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt, taking with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan. 
#Gn46-7: Jacob brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters —all his offspring. 
#Gn46-8: These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob. 
#Gn46-9: The sons of Reuben: Hanok, Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. 
#Gn46-10: The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 
#Gn46-11: The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. 
#Gn46-12: The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul. 
#Gn46-13: The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puah, "Jashub "and Shimron. 
#Gn46-14: The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon and Jahleel. 
#Gn46-15: These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, "besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all. 
#Gn46-16: The sons of Gad: Zephon, "Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli. 
#Gn46-17: The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malkiel. 
#Gn46-18: These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah —sixteen in all. 
#Gn46-19: The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
#Gn46-20: In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. [^5] 
#Gn46-21: The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard. 
#Gn46-22: These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob —fourteen in all. 
#Gn46-23: The son of Dan: Hushim. 
#Gn46-24: The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem. 
#Gn46-25: These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel —seven in all. 
#Gn46-26: All those who went to Egypt with Jacob —those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons' wives —numbered sixty-six persons. 
#Gn46-27: With the two sons "who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob's family, which went to Egypt, were seventy "in all. 
#Gn46-28: Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen, 
#Gn46-29: Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father "and wept for a long time. 
#Gn46-30: Israel said to Joseph, "Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive." 
#Gn46-31: Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me. 
#Gn46-32: The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.' 
#Gn46-33: When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, 'What is your occupation?' 
#Gn46-34: you should answer, 'Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.' Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians."
 GÊNESIS 47
#Gn47-1: Joseph went and told Pharaoh, "My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen." 
#Gn47-2: He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh. 
#Gn47-3: Pharaoh asked the brothers, "What is your occupation?" "Your servants are shepherds," they replied to Pharaoh, "just as our fathers were." 
#Gn47-4: They also said to him, "We have come to live here for a while, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants' flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen." 
#Gn47-5: Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you, 
#Gn47-6: and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock." 
#Gn47-7: Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed "Pharaoh, 
#Gn47-8: Pharaoh asked him, "How old are you?" 
#Gn47-9: And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers." 
#Gn47-10: Then Jacob blessed "Pharaoh and went out from his presence. 
#Gn47-11: So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed. 
#Gn47-12: Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their children. 
#Gn47-13: There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine. 
#Gn47-14: Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh's palace. 
#Gn47-15: When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, "Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is all gone." 
#Gn47-16: "Then bring your livestock," said Joseph. "I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone." 
#Gn47-17: So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock. 
#Gn47-18: When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, "We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land. 
#Gn47-19: Why should we perish before your eyes —we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate." 
#Gn47-20: So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh's, 
#Gn47-21: and Joseph reduced the people to servitude, "from one end of Egypt to the other. 
#Gn47-22: However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land. 
#Gn47-23: Joseph said to the people, "Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground. 
#Gn47-24: But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children." 
#Gn47-25: "You have saved our lives," they said. "May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh." 
#Gn47-26: So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt —still in force today —that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh's. 
#Gn47-27: Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number. 
#Gn47-28: Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven. 
#Gn47-29: When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, 
#Gn47-30: but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried." "I will do as you say," he said. 
#Gn47-31: "Swear to me," he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. [^4]
 GÊNESIS 48
#Gn48-1: Some time later Joseph was told, "Your father is ill." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him. 
#Gn48-2: When Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has come to you," Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed. 
#Gn48-3: Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty "appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me 
#Gn48-4: and said to me, 'I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.' 
#Gn48-5: "Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 
#Gn48-6: Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers. 
#Gn48-7: As I was returning from Paddan, "to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath" (that is, Bethlehem). 
#Gn48-8: When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, "Who are these?" 
#Gn48-9: "They are the sons God has given me here," Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, "Bring them to me so I may bless them." 
#Gn48-10: Now Israel's eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. 
#Gn48-11: Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too." 
#Gn48-12: Then Joseph removed them from Israel's knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. 
#Gn48-13: And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel's right hand, and brought them close to him. 
#Gn48-14: But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim's head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh's head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. 
#Gn48-15: Then he blessed Joseph and said, "May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, 
#Gn48-16: the Angel who has delivered me from all harm —may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly on the earth." 
#Gn48-17: When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim's head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. 
#Gn48-18: Joseph said to him, "No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head." 
#Gn48-19: But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations." 
#Gn48-20: He blessed them that day and said, "In your "name will Israel pronounce this blessing: 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'" So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. 
#Gn48-21: Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you "and take you "back to the land of your "fathers. 
#Gn48-22: And to you I give one more ridge of land "than to your brothers, the ridge I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow."

#Gn49-2: "Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel. 
#Gn49-3: "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power. 
#Gn49-4: Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it. 
#Gn49-5: "Simeon and Levi are brothers — their swords "are weapons of violence.

#Gn49-8: "Judah, "your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons will bow down to you. 
#Gn49-9: You are a lion's cub, Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness —who dares to rouse him? 
#Gn49-10: The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, "until he to whom it belongs "shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his. 
#Gn49-11: He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. 
#Gn49-12: His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk. [^5] 
#Gn49-13: "Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon.

#Gn49-16: "Dan "will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel. 
#Gn49-17: Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider tumbles backward. 
#Gn49-18: "I look for your deliverance, LORD. 
#Gn49-19: "Gad "will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels. 
#Gn49-20: "Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king. 
#Gn49-21: "Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns. [^10] 
#Gn49-22: "Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall. [^11] 
#Gn49-23: With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility. 
#Gn49-24: But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed "limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, 
#Gn49-25: because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, "who blesses you with blessings of the skies above, blessings of the deep springs below, blessings of the breast and womb. 
#Gn49-26: Your father's blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than "the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among "his brothers. 
#Gn49-27: "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder." 
#Gn49-28: All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him. 
#Gn49-29: Then he gave them these instructions: "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
#Gn49-30: the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite. 
#Gn49-31: There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah. 
#Gn49-32: The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. "" 
#Gn49-33: When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.
 GÊNESIS 50
#Gn50-1: Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him. 
#Gn50-2: Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him, 
#Gn50-3: taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. 
#Gn50-4: When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh's court, "If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, 
#Gn50-5: 'My father made me swear an oath and said, "I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan." Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.'" 
#Gn50-6: Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do." 
#Gn50-7: So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh's officials accompanied him —the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt — 
#Gn50-8: besides all the members of Joseph's household and his brothers and those belonging to his father's household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen. 
#Gn50-9: Chariots and horsemen "also went up with him. It was a very large company. 
#Gn50-10: When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father. 
#Gn50-11: When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning." That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim. [^2] 
#Gn50-12: So Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them: 
#Gn50-13: They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite. 
#Gn50-14: After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father. 
#Gn50-15: When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?" 
#Gn50-16: So they sent word to Joseph, saying, "Your father left these instructions before he died: 
#Gn50-17: 'This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.' Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father." When their message came to him, Joseph wept. 
#Gn50-18: His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. "We are your slaves," they said. 
#Gn50-19: But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God? 
#Gn50-20: You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. 
#Gn50-21: So then, don't be afraid. I will provide for you and your children." And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them. 
#Gn50-22: Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years 
#Gn50-23: and saw the third generation of Ephraim's children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph's knees. [^3] 
#Gn50-24: Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob." 
#Gn50-25: And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place." 
#Gn50-26: So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
ÊXODO
 ÊXODO 1
#Êx1-1: These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: 
#Êx1-2: Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; 
#Êx1-3: Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 
#Êx1-4: Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 
#Êx1-5: The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy "in all; Joseph was already in Egypt. 
#Êx1-6: Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 
#Êx1-7: but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them. 
#Êx1-8: Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. 
#Êx1-9: "Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. 
#Êx1-10: Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country." 
#Êx1-11: So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 
#Êx1-12: But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites 
#Êx1-13: and worked them ruthlessly. 
#Êx1-14: They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly. 
#Êx1-15: The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 
#Êx1-16: "When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live." 
#Êx1-17: The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. 
#Êx1-18: Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?" 
#Êx1-19: The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive." 
#Êx1-20: So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. 
#Êx1-21: And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. 
#Êx1-22: Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."
 ÊXODO 2
#Êx2-1: Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman, 
#Êx2-2: and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months. 
#Êx2-3: But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket "for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. 
#Êx2-4: His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him. 
#Êx2-5: Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it. 
#Êx2-6: She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said. 
#Êx2-7: Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?" 
#Êx2-8: "Yes, go," she answered. So the girl went and got the baby's mother. 
#Êx2-9: Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him. 
#Êx2-10: When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, "saying, "I drew him out of the water." 
#Êx2-11: One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. 
#Êx2-12: Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 
#Êx2-13: The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?" 
#Êx2-14: The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known." 
#Êx2-15: When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well. 
#Êx2-16: Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock. 
#Êx2-17: Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock. 
#Êx2-18: When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?" 
#Êx2-19: They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock." 
#Êx2-20: "And where is he?" Reuel asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat." 
#Êx2-21: Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. 
#Êx2-22: Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, "saying, "I have become a foreigner in a foreign land." 
#Êx2-23: During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God. 
#Êx2-24: God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. 
#Êx2-25: So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
 ÊXODO 3
#Êx3-1: Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 
#Êx3-2: There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. 
#Êx3-3: So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight —why the bush does not burn up." 
#Êx3-4: When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am." 
#Êx3-5: "Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." 
#Êx3-6: Then he said, "I am the God of your father, "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God. 
#Êx3-7: The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. 
#Êx3-8: So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey —the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
#Êx3-9: And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. 
#Êx3-10: So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt." 
#Êx3-11: But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?" 
#Êx3-12: And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you "will worship God on this mountain." 
#Êx3-13: Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?" 
#Êx3-14: God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. "This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'" 
#Êx3-15: God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The LORD, "the God of your fathers —the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob —has sent me to you.' "This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation. 
#Êx3-16: "Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers —the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob —appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. 
#Êx3-17: And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites —a land flowing with milk and honey.' 
#Êx3-18: "The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.' 
#Êx3-19: But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him. 
#Êx3-20: So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go. 
#Êx3-21: "And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed. 
#Êx3-22: Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."
 ÊXODO 4
#Êx4-1: Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, 'The LORD did not appear to you'?" 
#Êx4-2: Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied. 
#Êx4-3: The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it. 
#Êx4-4: Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand. 
#Êx4-5: "This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers —the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob —has appeared to you." 
#Êx4-6: Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous "—it had become as white as snow. 
#Êx4-7: "Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh. 
#Êx4-8: Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second. 
#Êx4-9: But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground." 
#Êx4-10: Moses said to the LORD, "Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue." 
#Êx4-11: The LORD said to him, "Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the LORD? 
#Êx4-12: Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say." 
#Êx4-13: But Moses said, "Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else." 
#Êx4-14: Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you. 
#Êx4-15: You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do. 
#Êx4-16: He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him. 
#Êx4-17: But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it." 
#Êx4-18: Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well." 
#Êx4-19: Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead." 
#Êx4-20: So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand. 
#Êx4-21: The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go. 
#Êx4-22: Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son, 
#Êx4-23: and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'" 
#Êx4-24: At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses "and was about to kill him. 
#Êx4-25: But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' feet with it. ""Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said. 
#Êx4-26: So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.) 
#Êx4-27: The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him. 
#Êx4-28: Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform. 
#Êx4-29: Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites, 
#Êx4-30: and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people, 
#Êx4-31: and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
 ÊXODO 5
#Êx5-1: Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.'" 
#Êx5-2: Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go." 
#Êx5-3: Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword." 
#Êx5-4: But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!" 
#Êx5-5: Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working." 
#Êx5-6: That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people: 
#Êx5-7: "You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. 
#Êx5-8: But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.' 
#Êx5-9: Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies." 
#Êx5-10: Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you any more straw. 
#Êx5-11: Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'" 
#Êx5-12: So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. 
#Êx5-13: The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw." 
#Êx5-14: And Pharaoh's slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, "Why haven't you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?" 
#Êx5-15: Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you treated your servants this way? 
#Êx5-16: Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people." 
#Êx5-17: Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are —lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.' 
#Êx5-18: Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks." 
#Êx5-19: The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day." 
#Êx5-20: When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them, 
#Êx5-21: and they said, "May the LORD look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us." 
#Êx5-22: Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me? 
#Êx5-23: Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."
 ÊXODO 6
#Êx6-1: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country." 
#Êx6-2: God also said to Moses, "I am the LORD. 
#Êx6-3: I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, "but by my name the LORD "I did not make myself fully known to them. 
#Êx6-4: I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners. 
#Êx6-5: Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant. 
#Êx6-6: "Therefore, say to the Israelites: 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. 
#Êx6-7: I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. 
#Êx6-8: And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'" 
#Êx6-9: Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor. 
#Êx6-10: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx6-11: "Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country." 
#Êx6-12: But Moses said to the LORD, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips "?" 
#Êx6-13: Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. 
#Êx6-14: These were the heads of their families ": The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanok and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the clans of Reuben. 
#Êx6-15: The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon. 
#Êx6-16: These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years. 
#Êx6-17: The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei. 
#Êx6-18: The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years. 
#Êx6-19: The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records. 
#Êx6-20: Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years. 
#Êx6-21: The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri. 
#Êx6-22: The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri. 
#Êx6-23: Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
#Êx6-24: The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans. 
#Êx6-25: Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan. 
#Êx6-26: It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions." 
#Êx6-27: They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt —this same Moses and Aaron. 
#Êx6-28: Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt, 
#Êx6-29: he said to him, "I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you." 
#Êx6-30: But Moses said to the LORD, "Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?"
 ÊXODO 7
#Êx7-1: Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. 
#Êx7-2: You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country. 
#Êx7-3: But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt, 
#Êx7-4: he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites. 
#Êx7-5: And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it." 
#Êx7-6: Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them. 
#Êx7-7: Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh. 
#Êx7-8: The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
#Êx7-9: "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a miracle,' then say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,' and it will become a snake." 
#Êx7-10: So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake. 
#Êx7-11: Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts: 
#Êx7-12: Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs. 
#Êx7-13: Yet Pharaoh's heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said. 
#Êx7-14: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. 
#Êx7-15: Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. 
#Êx7-16: Then say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened. 
#Êx7-17: This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood. 
#Êx7-18: The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.'" 
#Êx7-19: The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt —over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs —and they will turn to blood.' Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels "of wood and stone." 
#Êx7-20: Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood. 
#Êx7-21: The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt. 
#Êx7-22: But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh's heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. 
#Êx7-23: Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart. 
#Êx7-24: And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river. 
#Êx7-25: Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.
 ÊXODO 8
#Êx8-1: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 
#Êx8-2: If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country. 
#Êx8-3: The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs. 
#Êx8-4: The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.'" 
#Êx8-5: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'" 
#Êx8-6: So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land. 
#Êx8-7: But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt. 
#Êx8-8: Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD." 
#Êx8-9: Moses said to Pharaoh, "I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile." 
#Êx8-10: "Tomorrow," Pharaoh said. Moses replied, "It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the LORD our God. 
#Êx8-11: The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile." 
#Êx8-12: After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh. 
#Êx8-13: And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields. 
#Êx8-14: They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them. 
#Êx8-15: But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. 
#Êx8-16: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,' and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats." 
#Êx8-17: They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats. 
#Êx8-18: But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere, 
#Êx8-19: the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the LORD had said. 
#Êx8-20: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 
#Êx8-21: If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them. 
#Êx8-22: "'But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the LORD, am in this land. 
#Êx8-23: I will make a distinction "between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.'" 
#Êx8-24: And the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies. 
#Êx8-25: Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land." 
#Êx8-26: But Moses said, "That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us? 
#Êx8-27: We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us." 
#Êx8-28: Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me." 
#Êx8-29: Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD." 
#Êx8-30: Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD, 
#Êx8-31: and the LORD did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained. 
#Êx8-32: But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.
 ÊXODO 9
#Êx9-1: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, so that they may worship me." 
#Êx9-2: If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, 
#Êx9-3: the hand of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field —on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats. 
#Êx9-4: But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.'" 
#Êx9-5: The LORD set a time and said, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land." 
#Êx9-6: And the next day the LORD did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died. 
#Êx9-7: Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go. 
#Êx9-8: Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh. 
#Êx9-9: It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land." 
#Êx9-10: So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals. 
#Êx9-11: The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians. 
#Êx9-12: But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses. 
#Êx9-13: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me, 
#Êx9-14: or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. 
#Êx9-15: For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. 
#Êx9-16: But I have raised you up "for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth. 
#Êx9-17: You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go. 
#Êx9-18: Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now. 
#Êx9-19: Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.'" 
#Êx9-20: Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside. 
#Êx9-21: But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field. 
#Êx9-22: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt —on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt." 
#Êx9-23: When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt; 
#Êx9-24: hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. 
#Êx9-25: Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields —both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree. 
#Êx9-26: The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were. 
#Êx9-27: Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. "This time I have sinned," he said to them. "The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong. 
#Êx9-28: Pray to the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't have to stay any longer." 
#Êx9-29: Moses replied, "When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the LORD's. 
#Êx9-30: But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God." 
#Êx9-31: (The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom. 
#Êx9-32: The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.) 
#Êx9-33: Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the LORD; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land. 
#Êx9-34: When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts. 
#Êx9-35: So Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.
 ÊXODO 10
#Êx10-1: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs of mine among them 
#Êx10-2: that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the LORD." 
#Êx10-3: So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 
#Êx10-4: If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow. 
#Êx10-5: They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields. 
#Êx10-6: They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians —something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh. 
#Êx10-7: Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?" 
#Êx10-8: Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But tell me who will be going." 
#Êx10-9: Moses answered, "We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD." 
#Êx10-10: Pharaoh said, "The LORD be with you —if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil. [^1] 
#Êx10-11: No! Have only the men go and worship the LORD, since that's what you have been asking for." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence. 
#Êx10-12: And the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail." 
#Êx10-13: So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts; 
#Êx10-14: they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again. 
#Êx10-15: They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail —everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt. 
#Êx10-16: Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you. 
#Êx10-17: Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me." 
#Êx10-18: Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD. 
#Êx10-19: And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. "Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt. 
#Êx10-20: But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go. 
#Êx10-21: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt —darkness that can be felt." 
#Êx10-22: So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. 
#Êx10-23: No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived. 
#Êx10-24: Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind." 
#Êx10-25: But Moses said, "You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God. 
#Êx10-26: Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD." 
#Êx10-27: But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go. 
#Êx10-28: Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die." 
#Êx10-29: "Just as you say," Moses replied. "I will never appear before you again."
 ÊXODO 11
#Êx11-1: Now the LORD had said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely. 
#Êx11-2: Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold." 
#Êx11-3: (The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and by the people.) 
#Êx11-4: So Moses said, "This is what the LORD says: 'About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. 
#Êx11-5: Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. 
#Êx11-6: There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt —worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. 
#Êx11-7: But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.' Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. 
#Êx11-8: All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, 'Go, you and all the people who follow you!' After that I will leave." Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh. 
#Êx11-9: The LORD had said to Moses, "Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you —so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt." 
#Êx11-10: Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.
 ÊXODO 12
#Êx12-1: The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, 
#Êx12-2: "This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. 
#Êx12-3: Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb "for his family, one for each household. 
#Êx12-4: If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat. 
#Êx12-5: The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats. 
#Êx12-6: Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. 
#Êx12-7: Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. 
#Êx12-8: That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast. 
#Êx12-9: Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire —with the head, legs and internal organs. 
#Êx12-10: Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it. 
#Êx12-11: This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD's Passover. 
#Êx12-12: "On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD. 
#Êx12-13: The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt. 
#Êx12-14: "This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD —a lasting ordinance. 
#Êx12-15: For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. 
#Êx12-16: On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do. 
#Êx12-17: "Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. 
#Êx12-18: In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. 
#Êx12-19: For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel. 
#Êx12-20: Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread." 
#Êx12-21: Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. 
#Êx12-22: Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning. 
#Êx12-23: When the LORD goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down. 
#Êx12-24: "Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants. 
#Êx12-25: When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony. 
#Êx12-26: And when your children ask you, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?' 
#Êx12-27: then tell them, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped. 
#Êx12-28: The Israelites did just what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron. 
#Êx12-29: At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well. 
#Êx12-30: Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead. 
#Êx12-31: During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested. 
#Êx12-32: Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me." 
#Êx12-33: The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. "For otherwise," they said, "we will all die!" 
#Êx12-34: So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing. 
#Êx12-35: The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing. 
#Êx12-36: The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians. 
#Êx12-37: The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. 
#Êx12-38: Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds. 
#Êx12-39: With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves. 
#Êx12-40: Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt "was 430 years. 
#Êx12-41: At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD's divisions left Egypt. 
#Êx12-42: Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come. 
#Êx12-43: The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the regulations for the Passover meal: "No foreigner may eat it. 
#Êx12-44: Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him, 
#Êx12-45: but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it. 
#Êx12-46: "It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones. 
#Êx12-47: The whole community of Israel must celebrate it. 
#Êx12-48: "A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the LORD's Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it. 
#Êx12-49: The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you." 
#Êx12-50: All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. 
#Êx12-51: And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
 ÊXODO 13
#Êx13-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx13-2: "Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal." 
#Êx13-3: Then Moses said to the people, "Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast. 
#Êx13-4: Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving. 
#Êx13-5: When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites —the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey —you are to observe this ceremony in this month: 
#Êx13-6: For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD. 
#Êx13-7: Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders. 
#Êx13-8: On that day tell your son, 'I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.' 
#Êx13-9: This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand. 
#Êx13-10: You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year. 
#Êx13-11: "After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors, 
#Êx13-12: you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD. 
#Êx13-13: Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons. 
#Êx13-14: "In days to come, when your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' say to him, 'With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
#Êx13-15: When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.' 
#Êx13-16: And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand." 
#Êx13-17: When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, "If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt." 
#Êx13-18: So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. "The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle. 
#Êx13-19: Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place." [^2] 
#Êx13-20: After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. 
#Êx13-21: By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. 
#Êx13-22: Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
 ÊXODO 14
#Êx14-1: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx14-2: "Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon. 
#Êx14-3: Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.' 
#Êx14-4: And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." So the Israelites did this. 
#Êx14-5: When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, "What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!" 
#Êx14-6: So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him. 
#Êx14-7: He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. 
#Êx14-8: The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly. 
#Êx14-9: The Egyptians —all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, horsemen "and troops —pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon. 
#Êx14-10: As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD. 
#Êx14-11: They said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 
#Êx14-12: Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!" 
#Êx14-13: Moses answered the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. 
#Êx14-14: The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still." 
#Êx14-15: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. 
#Êx14-16: Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. 
#Êx14-17: I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. 
#Êx14-18: The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen." 
#Êx14-19: Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them, 
#Êx14-20: coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long. 
#Êx14-21: Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided, 
#Êx14-22: and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. 
#Êx14-23: The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea. 
#Êx14-24: During the last watch of the night the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion. 
#Êx14-25: He jammed "the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, "Let's get away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt." 
#Êx14-26: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen." 
#Êx14-27: Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward "it, and the LORD swept them into the sea. 
#Êx14-28: The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen —the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived. 
#Êx14-29: But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. 
#Êx14-30: That day the LORD saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore. 
#Êx14-31: And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.
 ÊXODO 15
#Êx15-1: Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: "I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea. 
#Êx15-2: "The LORD is my strength and my defense "; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him. 
#Êx15-3: The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name. 
#Êx15-4: Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaoh's officers are drowned in the Red Sea. [^2] 
#Êx15-5: The deep waters have covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone. 
#Êx15-6: Your right hand, LORD, was majestic in power. Your right hand, LORD, shattered the enemy. 
#Êx15-7: "In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger; it consumed them like stubble. 
#Êx15-8: By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood up like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea. 
#Êx15-9: The enemy boasted, 'I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.' 
#Êx15-10: But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
#Êx15-11: Who among the gods is like you, LORD? Who is like you — majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders? 
#Êx15-12: "You stretch out your right hand, and the earth swallows your enemies. 
#Êx15-13: In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling. 
#Êx15-14: The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the people of Philistia. 
#Êx15-15: The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, the people "of Canaan will melt away; 
#Êx15-16: terror and dread will fall on them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone — until your people pass by, LORD, until the people you bought "pass by. 
#Êx15-17: You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance — the place, LORD, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established. 
#Êx15-18: "The LORD reigns for ever and ever." 
#Êx15-19: When Pharaoh's horses, chariots and horsemen "went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. 
#Êx15-20: Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron's sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing. 
#Êx15-21: Miriam sang to them: "Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea." 
#Êx15-22: Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water. 
#Êx15-23: When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. ") 
#Êx15-24: So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, "What are we to drink?" 
#Êx15-25: Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink. There the LORD issued a ruling and instruction for them and put them to the test. 
#Êx15-26: He said, "If you listen carefully to the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you." 
#Êx15-27: Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.
 ÊXODO 16
#Êx16-1: The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt. 
#Êx16-2: In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. 
#Êx16-3: The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death." 
#Êx16-4: Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions. 
#Êx16-5: On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days." 
#Êx16-6: So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt, 
#Êx16-7: and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?" 
#Êx16-8: Moses also said, "You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD." 
#Êx16-9: Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, 'Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'" 
#Êx16-10: While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud. 
#Êx16-11: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx16-12: "I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'" 
#Êx16-13: That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. 
#Êx16-14: When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor. 
#Êx16-15: When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat. 
#Êx16-16: This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer "for each person you have in your tent.'" 
#Êx16-17: The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little. 
#Êx16-18: And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed. 
#Êx16-19: Then Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning." 
#Êx16-20: However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them. 
#Êx16-21: Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. 
#Êx16-22: On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much —two omers "for each person —and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses. 
#Êx16-23: He said to them, "This is what the LORD commanded: 'Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'" 
#Êx16-24: So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it. 
#Êx16-25: "Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today. 
#Êx16-26: Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any." 
#Êx16-27: Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none. 
#Êx16-28: Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you "refuse to keep my commands and my instructions? 
#Êx16-29: Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out." 
#Êx16-30: So the people rested on the seventh day. 
#Êx16-31: The people of Israel called the bread manna. "It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey. 
#Êx16-32: Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.'" 
#Êx16-33: So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come." 
#Êx16-34: As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved. 
#Êx16-35: The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan. 
#Êx16-36: (An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)
 ÊXODO 17
#Êx17-1: The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. 
#Êx17-2: So they quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses replied, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the LORD to the test?" 
#Êx17-3: But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, "Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?" 
#Êx17-4: Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me." 
#Êx17-5: The LORD answered Moses, "Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. 
#Êx17-6: I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
#Êx17-7: And he called the place Massah "and Meribah "because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the LORD saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?" 
#Êx17-8: The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. 
#Êx17-9: Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands." 
#Êx17-10: So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill. 
#Êx17-11: As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. 
#Êx17-12: When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up —one on one side, one on the other —so that his hands remained steady till sunset. 
#Êx17-13: So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword. 
#Êx17-14: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven." 
#Êx17-15: Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner. 
#Êx17-16: He said, "Because hands were lifted up against "the throne of the LORD, "the LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation."
 ÊXODO 18
#Êx18-1: Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. 
#Êx18-2: After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her 
#Êx18-3: and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, "for Moses said, "I have become a foreigner in a foreign land"; 
#Êx18-4: and the other was named Eliezer, "for he said, "My father's God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh." 
#Êx18-5: Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, together with Moses' sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God. 
#Êx18-6: Jethro had sent word to him, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons." 
#Êx18-7: So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent. 
#Êx18-8: Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them. 
#Êx18-9: Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians. 
#Êx18-10: He said, "Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians. 
#Êx18-11: Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly." 
#Êx18-12: Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God. 
#Êx18-13: The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening. 
#Êx18-14: When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, "What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?" 
#Êx18-15: Moses answered him, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will. 
#Êx18-16: Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and instructions." 
#Êx18-17: Moses' father-in-law replied, "What you are doing is not good. 
#Êx18-18: You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. 
#Êx18-19: Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to him. 
#Êx18-20: Teach them his decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave. 
#Êx18-21: But select capable men from all the people —men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain —and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
#Êx18-22: Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. 
#Êx18-23: If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied." 
#Êx18-24: Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
#Êx18-25: He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
#Êx18-26: They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves. 
#Êx18-27: Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.
 ÊXODO 19
#Êx19-1: On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt —on that very day —they came to the Desert of Sinai. 
#Êx19-2: After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain. 
#Êx19-3: Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, "This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel: 
#Êx19-4: 'You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. 
#Êx19-5: Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, 
#Êx19-6: you "will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites." 
#Êx19-7: So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak. 
#Êx19-8: The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD. 
#Êx19-9: The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said. 
#Êx19-10: And the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes 
#Êx19-11: and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. 
#Êx19-12: Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, 'Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death. 
#Êx19-13: They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.' Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain." 
#Êx19-14: After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. 
#Êx19-15: Then he said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations." 
#Êx19-16: On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. 
#Êx19-17: Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
#Êx19-18: Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain "trembled violently. 
#Êx19-19: As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him. [^3] 
#Êx19-20: The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up 
#Êx19-21: and the LORD said to him, "Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish. 
#Êx19-22: Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them." 
#Êx19-23: Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, 'Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.'" 
#Êx19-24: The LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them." 
#Êx19-25: So Moses went down to the people and told them.

#Êx20-4: "You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.

#Êx20-11: For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

#Êx20-19: and said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die." 
#Êx20-20: Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning." 
#Êx20-21: The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was. 
#Êx20-22: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites this: 'You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven: 
#Êx20-23: Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold. 
#Êx20-24: "'Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you. 
#Êx20-25: If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it. 
#Êx20-26: And do not go up to my altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.'

#Êx23-30: Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land. 
#Êx23-31: "I will establish your borders from the Red Sea "to the Mediterranean Sea, "and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out before you.

#Êx24-10: and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli, as bright blue as the sky.

#Êx30-11: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx30-12: "When you take a census of the Israelites to count them, each one must pay the LORD a ransom for his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come on them when you number them. 
#Êx30-13: Each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel, "according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the LORD. 
#Êx30-14: All who cross over, those twenty years old or more, are to give an offering to the LORD. 
#Êx30-15: The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives. 
#Êx30-16: Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD, making atonement for your lives." 
#Êx30-17: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx30-18: "Make a bronze basin, with its bronze stand, for washing. Place it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it. 
#Êx30-19: Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet with water from it. 
#Êx30-20: Whenever they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water so that they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister by presenting a food offering to the LORD, 
#Êx30-21: they shall wash their hands and feet so that they will not die. This is to be a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come." 
#Êx30-22: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx30-23: "Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels "of liquid myrrh, half as much (that is, 250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels "of fragrant calamus, 
#Êx30-24: 500 shekels of cassia —all according to the sanctuary shekel —and a hin "of olive oil. 
#Êx30-25: Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil. 
#Êx30-26: Then use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law, 
#Êx30-27: the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense, 
#Êx30-28: the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.

#Êx30-31: Say to the Israelites, 'This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the generations to come. 
#Êx30-32: Do not pour it on anyone else's body and do not make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to consider it sacred. 
#Êx30-33: Whoever makes perfume like it and puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.'" 
#Êx30-34: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Take fragrant spices —gum resin, onycha and galbanum —and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts, 
#Êx30-35: and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred. 
#Êx30-36: Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you. 
#Êx30-37: Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the LORD. 
#Êx30-38: Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people."
 ÊXODO 31
#Êx31-1: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx31-2: "See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 
#Êx31-3: and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills — 
#Êx31-4: to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, 
#Êx31-5: to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of crafts. 
#Êx31-6: Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you: 
#Êx31-7: the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent — 
#Êx31-8: the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense, 
#Êx31-9: the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand — 
#Êx31-10: and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests, 
#Êx31-11: and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you." 
#Êx31-12: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Êx31-13: "Say to the Israelites, 'You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy. 
#Êx31-14: "'Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death; those who do any work on that day must be cut off from their people. 
#Êx31-15: For six days work is to be done, but the seventh day is a day of sabbath rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death. 
#Êx31-16: The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant. 
#Êx31-17: It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'" 
#Êx31-18: When the LORD finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
 ÊXODO 32
#Êx32-1: When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods "who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him." 
#Êx32-2: Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me." 
#Êx32-3: So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron. 
#Êx32-4: He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, "These are your gods, "Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." 
#Êx32-5: When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD." 
#Êx32-6: So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry. 
#Êx32-7: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt. 
#Êx32-8: They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.' 
#Êx32-9: "I have seen these people," the LORD said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people. 
#Êx32-10: Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation." 
#Êx32-11: But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. "LORD," he said, "why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? 
#Êx32-12: Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. 
#Êx32-13: Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'" 
#Êx32-14: Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened. 
#Êx32-15: Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. 
#Êx32-16: The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. 
#Êx32-17: When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp." 
#Êx32-18: Moses replied: "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear." 
#Êx32-19: When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. 
#Êx32-20: And he took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it. 
#Êx32-21: He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?" 
#Êx32-22: "Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron answered. "You know how prone these people are to evil. 
#Êx32-23: They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.' 
#Êx32-24: So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!" 
#Êx32-25: Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. 
#Êx32-26: So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him. 
#Êx32-27: Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'" 
#Êx32-28: The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. 
#Êx32-29: Then Moses said, "You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day." 
#Êx32-30: The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin." 
#Êx32-31: So Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. 
#Êx32-32: But now, please forgive their sin —but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written." 
#Êx32-33: The LORD replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book. 
#Êx32-34: Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin." 
#Êx32-35: And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
 ÊXODO 33
#Êx33-1: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.' 
#Êx33-2: I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
#Êx33-3: Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way." 
#Êx33-4: When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments. 
#Êx33-5: For the LORD had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.'" 
#Êx33-6: So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb. 
#Êx33-7: Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the "tent of meeting." Anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp. 
#Êx33-8: And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent. 
#Êx33-9: As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the LORD spoke with Moses. 
#Êx33-10: Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to their tent. 
#Êx33-11: The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent. 
#Êx33-12: Moses said to the LORD, "You have been telling me, 'Lead these people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know you by name and you have found favor with me.' 
#Êx33-13: If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people." 
#Êx33-14: The LORD replied, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest." 
#Êx33-15: Then Moses said to him, "If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. 
#Êx33-16: How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?" 
#Êx33-17: And the LORD said to Moses, "I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name." 
#Êx33-18: Then Moses said, "Now show me your glory." 
#Êx33-19: And the LORD said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 
#Êx33-20: But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live." 
#Êx33-21: Then the LORD said, "There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock. 
#Êx33-22: When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. 
#Êx33-23: Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen."
 ÊXODO 34
#Êx34-1: The LORD said to Moses, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
#Êx34-2: Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain. 
#Êx34-3: No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain." 
#Êx34-4: So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the LORD had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. 
#Êx34-5: Then the LORD came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the LORD. 
#Êx34-6: And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 
#Êx34-7: maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation." 
#Êx34-8: Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped. 
#Êx34-9: "Lord," he said, "if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance." 
#Êx34-10: Then the LORD said: "I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the LORD, will do for you. 
#Êx34-11: Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
#Êx34-12: Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you. 
#Êx34-13: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles. [^1] 
#Êx34-14: Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. 
#Êx34-15: "Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices. 
#Êx34-16: And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same. 
#Êx34-17: "Do not make any idols. 
#Êx34-18: "Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt. 
#Êx34-19: "The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock. 
#Êx34-20: Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. "No one is to appear before me empty-handed. 
#Êx34-21: "Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest. 
#Êx34-22: "Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year. [^2] 
#Êx34-23: Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel. 
#Êx34-24: I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the LORD your God. 
#Êx34-25: "Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning. 
#Êx34-26: "Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. "Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk." 
#Êx34-27: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel." 
#Êx34-28: Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant —the Ten Commandments. 
#Êx34-29: When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD. 
#Êx34-30: When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him. 
#Êx34-31: But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them. 
#Êx34-32: Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai. 
#Êx34-33: When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face. 
#Êx34-34: But whenever he entered the LORD's presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, 
#Êx34-35: they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.
 ÊXODO 35
#Êx35-1: Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, "These are the things the LORD has commanded you to do: 
#Êx35-2: For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death. 
#Êx35-3: Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day." 
#Êx35-4: Moses said to the whole Israelite community, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 
#Êx35-5: From what you have, take an offering for the LORD. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the LORD an offering of gold, silver and bronze; 
#Êx35-6: blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair; 
#Êx35-7: ram skins dyed red and another type of durable leather "; acacia wood; 
#Êx35-8: olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense; 
#Êx35-9: and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. 
#Êx35-10: "All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the LORD has commanded: 
#Êx35-11: the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases; 
#Êx35-12: the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it; 
#Êx35-13: the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence; 
#Êx35-14: the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light; 
#Êx35-15: the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle; 
#Êx35-16: the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand; 
#Êx35-17: the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; 
#Êx35-18: the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes; 
#Êx35-19: the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary —both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests." 
#Êx35-20: Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses' presence, 
#Êx35-21: and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved them came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments. 
#Êx35-22: All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD. 
#Êx35-23: Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or the other durable leather brought them. 
#Êx35-24: Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the LORD, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it. 
#Êx35-25: Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun —blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen. 
#Êx35-26: And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair. 
#Êx35-27: The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. 
#Êx35-28: They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. 
#Êx35-29: All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the LORD freewill offerings for all the work the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do. 
#Êx35-30: Then Moses said to the Israelites, "See, the LORD has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 
#Êx35-31: and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills — 
#Êx35-32: to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, 
#Êx35-33: to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts. 
#Êx35-34: And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others. 
#Êx35-35: He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers —all of them skilled workers and designers.
 ÊXODO 36
#Êx36-1: So Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the LORD has commanded." 
#Êx36-2: Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work. 
#Êx36-3: They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning. 
#Êx36-4: So all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing 
#Êx36-5: and said to Moses, "The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the LORD commanded to be done." 
#Êx36-6: Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: "No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." And so the people were restrained from bringing more, 
#Êx36-7: because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work. 
#Êx36-8: All those who were skilled among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands. 
#Êx36-9: All the curtains were the same size —twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide. [^1] 
#Êx36-10: They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five. 
#Êx36-11: Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set. 
#Êx36-12: They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other. 
#Êx36-13: Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit. 
#Êx36-14: They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle —eleven altogether. 
#Êx36-15: All eleven curtains were the same size —thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. [^2] 
#Êx36-16: They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set. 
#Êx36-17: Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set. 
#Êx36-18: They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit. 
#Êx36-19: Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather. [^3] 
#Êx36-20: They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle. 
#Êx36-21: Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide, [^4] 
#Êx36-22: with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way. 
#Êx36-23: They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle 
#Êx36-24: and made forty silver bases to go under them —two bases for each frame, one under each projection. 
#Êx36-25: For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames 
#Êx36-26: and forty silver bases —two under each frame. 
#Êx36-27: They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle, 
#Êx36-28: and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end. 
#Êx36-29: At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike. 
#Êx36-30: So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases —two under each frame. 
#Êx36-31: They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle, 
#Êx36-32: five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle. 
#Êx36-33: They made the center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle of the frames. 
#Êx36-34: They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold. 
#Êx36-35: They made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker. 
#Êx36-36: They made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases. 
#Êx36-37: For the entrance to the tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen —the work of an embroiderer; 
#Êx36-38: and they made five posts with hooks for them. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze.
 ÊXODO 37
#Êx37-1: Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood —two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. [^1] 
#Êx37-2: He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it. 
#Êx37-3: He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other. 
#Êx37-4: Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
#Êx37-5: And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it. 
#Êx37-6: He made the atonement cover of pure gold —two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 
#Êx37-7: Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover. 
#Êx37-8: He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover. 
#Êx37-9: The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover. 
#Êx37-10: They "made the table of acacia wood —two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high. [^3] 
#Êx37-11: Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it. 
#Êx37-12: They also made around it a rim a handbreadth "wide and put a gold molding on the rim. 
#Êx37-13: They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were. 
#Êx37-14: The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table. 
#Êx37-15: The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold. 
#Êx37-16: And they made from pure gold the articles for the table —its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings. 
#Êx37-17: They made the lampstand of pure gold. They hammered out its base and shaft, and made its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them. 
#Êx37-18: Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand —three on one side and three on the other. 
#Êx37-19: Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand. 
#Êx37-20: And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms. 
#Êx37-21: One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair —six branches in all. 
#Êx37-22: The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold. 
#Êx37-23: They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold. 
#Êx37-24: They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent "of pure gold. 
#Êx37-25: They made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide and two cubits high "—its horns of one piece with it. 
#Êx37-26: They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it. 
#Êx37-27: They made two gold rings below the molding —two on each of the opposite sides —to hold the poles used to carry it. 
#Êx37-28: They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
#Êx37-29: They also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense —the work of a perfumer.
 ÊXODO 38
#Êx38-1: They "built the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, three cubits "high; it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide. [^3] 
#Êx38-2: They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze. 
#Êx38-3: They made all its utensils of bronze —its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans. 
#Êx38-4: They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar. 
#Êx38-5: They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating. 
#Êx38-6: They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 
#Êx38-7: They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards. 
#Êx38-8: They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
#Êx38-9: Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits "long and had curtains of finely twisted linen, 
#Êx38-10: with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. 
#Êx38-11: The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. 
#Êx38-12: The west end was fifty cubits "wide and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. 
#Êx38-13: The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide. 
#Êx38-14: Curtains fifteen cubits "long were on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases, 
#Êx38-15: and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases. 
#Êx38-16: All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen. 
#Êx38-17: The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands. 
#Êx38-18: The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was made of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen —the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits "long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits "high, 
#Êx38-19: with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver. 
#Êx38-20: All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze. 
#Êx38-21: These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law, which were recorded at Moses' command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest. 
#Êx38-22: (Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the LORD commanded Moses; 
#Êx38-23: with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan —an engraver and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.) 
#Êx38-24: The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels, "according to the sanctuary shekel. 
#Êx38-25: The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents "and 1,775 shekels, "according to the sanctuary shekel — 
#Êx38-26: one beka per person, that is, half a shekel, "according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550 men. 
#Êx38-27: The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain —100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base. 
#Êx38-28: They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands.

#Êx40-20: He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it. 
#Êx40-21: Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the covenant law, as the LORD commanded him. 
#Êx40-22: Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain 
#Êx40-23: and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.

#Êx40-30: He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, 
#Êx40-31: and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet. 
#Êx40-32: They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Êx40-33: Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work. 
#Êx40-34: Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
#Êx40-35: Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
#Êx40-36: In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out; 
#Êx40-37: but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out —until the day it lifted. 
#Êx40-38: So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites during all their travels.

#Lv8-4: Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
#Lv8-5: Moses said to the assembly, "This is what the LORD has commanded to be done." 
#Lv8-6: Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water. 
#Lv8-7: He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative waistband, which he tied around him. 
#Lv8-8: He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece. 
#Lv8-9: Then he placed the turban on Aaron's head and set the gold plate, the sacred emblem, on the front of it, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Lv8-10: Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them. 
#Lv8-11: He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them. 
#Lv8-12: He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him. 
#Lv8-13: Then he brought Aaron's sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and fastened caps on them, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Lv8-14: He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 
#Lv8-15: Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it. 
#Lv8-16: Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar. 
#Lv8-17: But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned up outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Lv8-18: He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 
#Lv8-19: Then Moses slaughtered the ram and splashed the blood against the sides of the altar. 
#Lv8-20: He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat. 
#Lv8-21: He washed the internal organs and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Lv8-22: He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. 
#Lv8-23: Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. 
#Lv8-24: Moses also brought Aaron's sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splashed blood against the sides of the altar. 
#Lv8-25: After that, he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh. 
#Lv8-26: And from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the LORD, he took one thick loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf, and he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh. 
#Lv8-27: He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them before the LORD as a wave offering. 
#Lv8-28: Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD. 
#Lv8-29: Moses also took the breast, which was his share of the ordination ram, and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Lv8-30: Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments. 
#Lv8-31: Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, "Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: 'Aaron and his sons are to eat it.' 
#Lv8-32: Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread. 
#Lv8-33: Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days. 
#Lv8-34: What has been done today was commanded by the LORD to make atonement for you. 
#Lv8-35: You must stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and do what the LORD requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded."

#Lv9-2: He said to Aaron, "Take a bull calf for your sin offering "and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the LORD. 
#Lv9-3: Then say to the Israelites: 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb —both a year old and without defect —for a burnt offering, 
#Lv9-4: and an ox "and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the LORD, together with a grain offering mixed with olive oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.'" 
#Lv9-5: They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the LORD. 
#Lv9-6: Then Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you." 
#Lv9-7: Moses said to Aaron, "Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded." 
#Lv9-8: So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. 
#Lv9-9: His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar. 
#Lv9-10: On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the LORD commanded Moses; 
#Lv9-11: the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp. 
#Lv9-12: Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. 
#Lv9-13: They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar. 
#Lv9-14: He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.

#Lv9-17: He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning's burnt offering.

#Lv9-20: these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar. 
#Lv9-21: Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the LORD as a wave offering, as Moses commanded. 
#Lv9-22: Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down. 
#Lv9-23: Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.

 LEVÍTICO 10
#Lv10-1: Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to his command. 
#Lv10-2: So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD. 
#Lv10-3: Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD spoke of when he said: "'Among those who approach me I will be proved holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.'" Aaron remained silent. 
#Lv10-4: Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, "Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary." 
#Lv10-5: So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered. 
#Lv10-6: Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not let your hair become unkempt "and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the LORD will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites, may mourn for those the LORD has destroyed by fire. 
#Lv10-7: Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, because the LORD's anointing oil is on you." So they did as Moses said. 
#Lv10-8: Then the LORD said to Aaron, 
#Lv10-9: "You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, 
#Lv10-10: so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean, 
#Lv10-11: and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the LORD has given them through Moses." 
#Lv10-12: Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering left over from the food offerings prepared without yeast and presented to the LORD and eat it beside the altar, for it is most holy. 
#Lv10-13: Eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is your share and your sons' share of the food offerings presented to the LORD; for so I have been commanded. 
#Lv10-14: But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites' fellowship offerings. 
#Lv10-15: The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the food offerings, to be waved before the LORD as a wave offering. This will be the perpetual share for you and your children, as the LORD has commanded." 
#Lv10-16: When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering "and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, and asked, 
#Lv10-17: "Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the LORD. 
#Lv10-18: Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded." 
#Lv10-19: Aaron replied to Moses, "Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, but such things as this have happened to me. Would the LORD have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?" 
#Lv10-20: When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.

#Lv13-1: The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
#Lv13-2: "When anyone has a swelling or a rash or a shiny spot on their skin that may be a defiling skin disease, "they must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons "who is a priest. 
#Lv13-3: The priest is to examine the sore on the skin, and if the hair in the sore has turned white and the sore appears to be more than skin deep, it is a defiling skin disease. When the priest examines that person, he shall pronounce them ceremonially unclean. 
#Lv13-4: If the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days. 
#Lv13-5: On the seventh day the priest is to examine them, and if he sees that the sore is unchanged and has not spread in the skin, he is to isolate them for another seven days. 
#Lv13-6: On the seventh day the priest is to examine them again, and if the sore has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only a rash. They must wash their clothes, and they will be clean. 
#Lv13-7: But if the rash does spread in their skin after they have shown themselves to the priest to be pronounced clean, they must appear before the priest again. 
#Lv13-8: The priest is to examine that person, and if the rash has spread in the skin, he shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling skin disease. 
#Lv13-9: "When anyone has a defiling skin disease, they must be brought to the priest. 
#Lv13-10: The priest is to examine them, and if there is a white swelling in the skin that has turned the hair white and if there is raw flesh in the swelling, 
#Lv13-11: it is a chronic skin disease and the priest shall pronounce them unclean. He is not to isolate them, because they are already unclean. 
#Lv13-12: "If the disease breaks out all over their skin and, so far as the priest can see, it covers all the skin of the affected person from head to foot, 
#Lv13-13: the priest is to examine them, and if the disease has covered their whole body, he shall pronounce them clean. Since it has all turned white, they are clean. 
#Lv13-14: But whenever raw flesh appears on them, they will be unclean. 
#Lv13-15: When the priest sees the raw flesh, he shall pronounce them unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; they have a defiling disease. 
#Lv13-16: If the raw flesh changes and turns white, they must go to the priest. 
#Lv13-17: The priest is to examine them, and if the sores have turned white, the priest shall pronounce the affected person clean; then they will be clean.

#Lv13-21: But if, when the priest examines it, there is no white hair in it and it is not more than skin deep and has faded, then the priest is to isolate them for seven days. 
#Lv13-22: If it is spreading in the skin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a defiling disease.

#Lv25-11: The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines. 
#Lv25-12: For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields. 
#Lv25-13: "'In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property. 
#Lv25-14: "'If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of each other. 
#Lv25-15: You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops. 
#Lv25-16: When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops. 
#Lv25-17: Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the LORD your God. 
#Lv25-18: "'Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land. 
#Lv25-19: Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety. 
#Lv25-20: You may ask, "What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?" 
#Lv25-21: I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years. 
#Lv25-22: While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.

#Lv25-26: If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves, 
#Lv25-27: they are to determine the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then go back to their own property. 
#Lv25-28: But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then go back to their property. 
#Lv25-29: "'Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time the seller may redeem it. 
#Lv25-30: If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer's descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee. 
#Lv25-31: But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee. 
#Lv25-32: "'The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess. 
#Lv25-33: So the property of the Levites is redeemable —that is, a house sold in any town they hold —and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites. 
#Lv25-34: But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.

#Lv25-40: They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. 
#Lv25-41: Then they and their children are to be released, and they will go back to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors. 
#Lv25-42: Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.

#Lv25-49: An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves. 
#Lv25-50: They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years. 
#Lv25-51: If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them. 
#Lv25-52: If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly.

#Lv27-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Lv27-2: "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate a person to the LORD by giving the equivalent value, 
#Lv27-3: set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels "of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel "; 
#Lv27-4: for a female, set her value at thirty shekels "; 
#Lv27-5: for a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels "and of a female at ten shekels ";

#Lv27-11: If what they vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal —one that is not acceptable as an offering to the LORD —the animal must be presented to the priest, 
#Lv27-12: who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, that is what it will be.

#Lv27-16: "'If anyone dedicates to the LORD part of their family land, its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it —fifty shekels of silver to a homer "of barley seed. 
#Lv27-17: If they dedicate a field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has been set remains. 
#Lv27-18: But if they dedicate a field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced. 
#Lv27-19: If the one who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the field will again become theirs. 
#Lv27-20: If, however, they do not redeem the field, or if they have sold it to someone else, it can never be redeemed.

#Lv27-24: In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom it was bought, the one whose land it was.

#Lv27-26: "'No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the LORD; whether an ox "or a sheep, it is the LORD's. 
#Lv27-27: If it is one of the unclean animals, it may be bought back at its set value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If it is not redeemed, it is to be sold at its set value. 
#Lv27-28: "'But nothing that a person owns and devotes "to the LORD —whether a human being or an animal or family land —may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD. 
#Lv27-29: "'No person devoted to destruction "may be ransomed; they are to be put to death. 
#Lv27-30: "'A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD. 
#Lv27-31: Whoever would redeem any of their tithe must add a fifth of the value to it. 
#Lv27-32: Every tithe of the herd and flock —every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd's rod —will be holy to the LORD. 
#Lv27-33: No one may pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If anyone does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.'"

#Nm1-50: Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the covenant law —over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and encamp around it. 
#Nm1-51: Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who approaches it is to be put to death. 
#Nm1-52: The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each of them in their own camp under their standard. 
#Nm1-53: The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the covenant law so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the covenant law."

 NÚMEROS 3
#Nm3-1: This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai. 
#Nm3-2: The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
#Nm3-3: Those were the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests. 
#Nm3-4: Nadab and Abihu, however, died before the LORD when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron. 
#Nm3-5: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm3-6: "Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him. 
#Nm3-7: They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.

#Nm3-12: "I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine, 
#Nm3-13: for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal. They are to be mine. I am the LORD." 
#Nm3-14: The LORD said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai, 
#Nm3-15: "Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more."

#Nm3-32: The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.

#Nm3-37: as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes. 
#Nm3-38: Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.

#Nm3-41: Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am the LORD."

#Nm4-15: "After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, only then are the Kohathites to come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the tent of meeting. 
#Nm4-16: "Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its holy furnishings and articles."

#Nm4-20: But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die." 
#Nm4-21: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm4-22: "Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans. 
#Nm4-23: Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.

#Nm4-26: the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard, the ropes and all the equipment used in the service of the tent. The Gershonites are to do all that needs to be done with these things.

#Nm4-28: This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the tent of meeting. Their duties are to be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest. 
#Nm4-29: "Count the Merarites by their clans and families.

 NÚMEROS 5
#Nm5-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm5-2: "Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has a defiling skin disease "or a discharge of any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean because of a dead body. 
#Nm5-3: Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them." 
#Nm5-4: The Israelites did so; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses. 
#Nm5-5: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm5-6: "Say to the Israelites: 'Any man or woman who wrongs another in any way "and so is unfaithful to the LORD is guilty 
#Nm5-7: and must confess the sin they have committed. They must make full restitution for the wrong they have done, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all to the person they have wronged. 
#Nm5-8: But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the LORD and must be given to the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for the wrongdoer. 
#Nm5-9: All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him. 
#Nm5-10: Sacred things belong to their owners, but what they give to the priest will belong to the priest.'" 
#Nm5-11: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm5-12: "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'If a man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him 
#Nm5-13: so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act), 
#Nm5-14: and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure —or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure — 
#Nm5-15: then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah "of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing. 
#Nm5-16: "'The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the LORD. 
#Nm5-17: Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water. 
#Nm5-18: After the priest has had the woman stand before the LORD, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse. 
#Nm5-19: Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, "If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. 
#Nm5-20: But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband" — 
#Nm5-21: here the priest is to put the woman under this curse —"may the LORD cause you to become a curse "among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell. 
#Nm5-22: May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries." "'Then the woman is to say, "Amen. So be it." 
#Nm5-23: "'The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water. 
#Nm5-24: He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. 
#Nm5-25: The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the LORD and bring it to the altar. 
#Nm5-26: The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial "offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water. 
#Nm5-27: If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse. 
#Nm5-28: If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children. 
#Nm5-29: "'This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes herself impure while married to her husband, 
#Nm5-30: or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the LORD and is to apply this entire law to her. 
#Nm5-31: The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.'"
 NÚMEROS 6
#Nm6-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm6-2: "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'If a man or woman wants to make a special vow, a vow of dedication to the LORD as a Nazirite, 
#Nm6-3: they must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or other fermented drink. They must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins. 
#Nm6-4: As long as they remain under their Nazirite vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins. 
#Nm6-5: "'During the entire period of their Nazirite vow, no razor may be used on their head. They must be holy until the period of their dedication to the LORD is over; they must let their hair grow long. 
#Nm6-6: "'Throughout the period of their dedication to the LORD, the Nazirite must not go near a dead body. 
#Nm6-7: Even if their own father or mother or brother or sister dies, they must not make themselves ceremonially unclean on account of them, because the symbol of their dedication to God is on their head. 
#Nm6-8: Throughout the period of their dedication, they are consecrated to the LORD. 
#Nm6-9: "'If someone dies suddenly in the Nazirite's presence, thus defiling the hair that symbolizes their dedication, they must shave their head on the seventh day —the day of their cleansing. 
#Nm6-10: Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
#Nm6-11: The priest is to offer one as a sin offering "and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for the Nazirite because they sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. That same day they are to consecrate their head again. 
#Nm6-12: They must rededicate themselves to the LORD for the same period of dedication and must bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days do not count, because they became defiled during their period of dedication. 
#Nm6-13: "'Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the period of their dedication is over. They are to be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
#Nm6-14: There they are to present their offerings to the LORD: a year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering, 
#Nm6-15: together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of bread made with the finest flour and without yeast —thick loaves with olive oil mixed in, and thin loaves brushed with olive oil. 
#Nm6-16: "'The priest is to present all these before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering. 
#Nm6-17: He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to the LORD, together with its grain offering and drink offering. 
#Nm6-18: "'Then at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the hair that symbolizes their dedication. They are to take the hair and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering. 
#Nm6-19: "'After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair that symbolizes their dedication, the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and one thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket, both made without yeast. 
#Nm6-20: The priest shall then wave these before the LORD as a wave offering; they are holy and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine. 
#Nm6-21: "'This is the law of the Nazirite who vows offerings to the LORD in accordance with their dedication, in addition to whatever else they can afford. They must fulfill the vows they have made, according to the law of the Nazirite.'" 
#Nm6-22: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm6-23: "Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them: 
#Nm6-24: "'"The LORD bless you and keep you; 
#Nm6-25: the LORD make his face shine on you and be gracious to you; 
#Nm6-26: the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace."' 
#Nm6-27: "So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them."
 NÚMEROS 7
#Nm7-1: When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils. 
#Nm7-2: Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings.

 NÚMEROS 8
#Nm8-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm8-2: "Speak to Aaron and say to him, 'When you set up the lamps, see that all seven light up the area in front of the lampstand.'" 
#Nm8-3: Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Nm8-4: This is how the lampstand was made: It was made of hammered gold —from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the LORD had shown Moses. 
#Nm8-5: The LORD said to Moses: 
#Nm8-6: "Take the Levites from among all the Israelites and make them ceremonially clean. 
#Nm8-7: To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. And so they will purify themselves. 
#Nm8-8: Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of the finest flour mixed with olive oil; then you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering. [^1] 
#Nm8-9: Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community. 
#Nm8-10: You are to bring the Levites before the LORD, and the Israelites are to lay their hands on them. 
#Nm8-11: Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may be ready to do the work of the LORD. 
#Nm8-12: "Then the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, using one for a sin offering to the LORD and the other for a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites. 
#Nm8-13: Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and then present them as a wave offering to the LORD. 
#Nm8-14: In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the other Israelites, and the Levites will be mine. 
#Nm8-15: "After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering, they are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting. 
#Nm8-16: They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn, the first male offspring from every Israelite woman. 
#Nm8-17: Every firstborn male in Israel, whether human or animal, is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself. 
#Nm8-18: And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel. 
#Nm8-19: From among all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the tent of meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary." 
#Nm8-20: Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Nm8-21: The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD and made atonement for them to purify them. 
#Nm8-22: After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Nm8-23: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm8-24: "This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting, 
#Nm8-25: but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and work no longer. 
#Nm8-26: They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This, then, is how you are to assign the responsibilities of the Levites."
 NÚMEROS 9
#Nm9-1: The LORD spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He said, 
#Nm9-2: "Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time. 
#Nm9-3: Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations." 
#Nm9-4: So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover, 
#Nm9-5: and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Nm9-6: But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day 
#Nm9-7: and said to Moses, "We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting the LORD's offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?" 
#Nm9-8: Moses answered them, "Wait until I find out what the LORD commands concerning you." 
#Nm9-9: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm9-10: "Tell the Israelites: 'When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey, they are still to celebrate the LORD's Passover, 
#Nm9-11: but they are to do it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
#Nm9-12: They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations. 
#Nm9-13: But if anyone who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, they must be cut off from their people for not presenting the LORD's offering at the appointed time. They will bear the consequences of their sin. 
#Nm9-14: "'A foreigner residing among you is also to celebrate the LORD's Passover in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations for both the foreigner and the native-born.'" 
#Nm9-15: On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant law, was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire. 
#Nm9-16: That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire. 
#Nm9-17: Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped. 
#Nm9-18: At the LORD's command the Israelites set out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in camp. 
#Nm9-19: When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed the LORD's order and did not set out. 
#Nm9-20: Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the LORD's command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out. 
#Nm9-21: Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out. 
#Nm9-22: Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out. 
#Nm9-23: At the LORD's command they encamped, and at the LORD's command they set out. They obeyed the LORD's order, in accordance with his command through Moses.
 NÚMEROS 10
#Nm10-1: The LORD said to Moses: 
#Nm10-2: "Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out. 
#Nm10-3: When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
#Nm10-4: If only one is sounded, the leaders —the heads of the clans of Israel —are to assemble before you. 
#Nm10-5: When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out. 
#Nm10-6: At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out. 
#Nm10-7: To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting out. 
#Nm10-8: "The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come. 
#Nm10-9: When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the LORD your God and rescued from your enemies. 
#Nm10-10: Also at your times of rejoicing —your appointed festivals and New Moon feasts —you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the LORD your God." 
#Nm10-11: On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law. 
#Nm10-12: Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran. 
#Nm10-13: They set out, this first time, at the LORD's command through Moses. 
#Nm10-14: The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command. 
#Nm10-15: Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar, 
#Nm10-16: and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun. 
#Nm10-17: Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out. 
#Nm10-18: The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command. 
#Nm10-19: Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon, 
#Nm10-20: and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad. 
#Nm10-21: Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived. 
#Nm10-22: The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command. 
#Nm10-23: Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh, 
#Nm10-24: and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin. 
#Nm10-25: Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command. 
#Nm10-26: Pagiel son of Okran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, 
#Nm10-27: and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. 
#Nm10-28: This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out. 
#Nm10-29: Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel." 
#Nm10-30: He answered, "No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people." 
#Nm10-31: But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes. 
#Nm10-32: If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us." 
#Nm10-33: So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest. 
#Nm10-34: The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp. 
#Nm10-35: Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, "Rise up, LORD! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you." 
#Nm10-36: Whenever it came to rest, he said, "Return, LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel."
 NÚMEROS 11
#Nm11-1: Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the LORD, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. 
#Nm11-2: When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the LORD and the fire died down. 
#Nm11-3: So that place was called Taberah, "because fire from the LORD had burned among them. 
#Nm11-4: The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, "If only we had meat to eat! 
#Nm11-5: We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost —also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. 
#Nm11-6: But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!" 
#Nm11-7: The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin. 
#Nm11-8: The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into loaves. And it tasted like something made with olive oil. 
#Nm11-9: When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down. 
#Nm11-10: Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents. The LORD became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled. 
#Nm11-11: He asked the LORD, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? 
#Nm11-12: Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors? 
#Nm11-13: Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, 'Give us meat to eat!' 
#Nm11-14: I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me. 
#Nm11-15: If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me —if I have found favor in your eyes —and do not let me face my own ruin." 
#Nm11-16: The LORD said to Moses: "Bring me seventy of Israel's elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you. 
#Nm11-17: I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone. 
#Nm11-18: "Tell the people: 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it. 
#Nm11-19: You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days, 
#Nm11-20: but for a whole month —until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it —because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'" 
#Nm11-21: But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!' 
#Nm11-22: Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?" 
#Nm11-23: The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD's arm too short? Now you will see whether or not what I say will come true for you." 
#Nm11-24: So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the tent. 
#Nm11-25: Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied —but did not do so again. 
#Nm11-26: However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp. 
#Nm11-27: A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp." 
#Nm11-28: Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!" 
#Nm11-29: But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD's people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!" 
#Nm11-30: Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp. 
#Nm11-31: Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea. It scattered them up to two cubits "deep all around the camp, as far as a day's walk in any direction. 
#Nm11-32: All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. "Then they spread them out all around the camp. 
#Nm11-33: But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague. 
#Nm11-34: Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, "because there they buried the people who had craved other food. 
#Nm11-35: From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
 NÚMEROS 12
#Nm12-1: Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite. 
#Nm12-2: "Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?" they asked. "Hasn't he also spoken through us?" And the LORD heard this. 
#Nm12-3: (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.) 
#Nm12-4: At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, "Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you." So the three of them went out. 
#Nm12-5: Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward, 
#Nm12-6: he said, "Listen to my words: "When there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, reveal myself to them in visions, I speak to them in dreams. 
#Nm12-7: But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. 
#Nm12-8: With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?" 
#Nm12-9: The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them. 
#Nm12-10: When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam's skin was leprous "—it became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a defiling skin disease, 
#Nm12-11: and he said to Moses, "Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed. 
#Nm12-12: Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away." 
#Nm12-13: So Moses cried out to the LORD, "Please, God, heal her!" 
#Nm12-14: The LORD replied to Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back." 
#Nm12-15: So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back. 
#Nm12-16: After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.
 NÚMEROS 13
#Nm13-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm13-2: "Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders." 
#Nm13-3: So at the LORD's command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites. 
#Nm13-4: These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zakkur; 
#Nm13-5: from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; 
#Nm13-6: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 
#Nm13-7: from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; 
#Nm13-8: from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; 
#Nm13-9: from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; 
#Nm13-10: from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; 
#Nm13-11: from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi; 
#Nm13-12: from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; 
#Nm13-13: from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; 
#Nm13-14: from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; 
#Nm13-15: from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki. 
#Nm13-16: These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.) 
#Nm13-17: When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, "Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country. 
#Nm13-18: See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many. 
#Nm13-19: What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified? 
#Nm13-20: How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land." (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) 
#Nm13-21: So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath. 
#Nm13-22: They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
#Nm13-23: When they reached the Valley of Eshkol, "they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs. 
#Nm13-24: That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there. 
#Nm13-25: At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land. 
#Nm13-26: They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. 
#Nm13-27: They gave Moses this account: "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. 
#Nm13-28: But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there. 
#Nm13-29: The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan." 
#Nm13-30: Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it." 
#Nm13-31: But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are." 
#Nm13-32: And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size. 
#Nm13-33: We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."
 NÚMEROS 14
#Nm14-1: That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud. 
#Nm14-2: All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, "If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness! 
#Nm14-3: Why is the LORD bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?" 
#Nm14-4: And they said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt." 
#Nm14-5: Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there. 
#Nm14-6: Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes 
#Nm14-7: and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good. 
#Nm14-8: If the LORD is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us. 
#Nm14-9: Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them." 
#Nm14-10: But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites. 
#Nm14-11: The LORD said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them? 
#Nm14-12: I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they." 
#Nm14-13: Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them. 
#Nm14-14: And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, LORD, are with these people and that you, LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. 
#Nm14-15: If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say, 
#Nm14-16: 'The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.' 
#Nm14-17: "Now may the Lord's strength be displayed, just as you have declared: 
#Nm14-18: 'The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.' 
#Nm14-19: In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now." 
#Nm14-20: The LORD replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked. 
#Nm14-21: Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth, 
#Nm14-22: not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times — 
#Nm14-23: not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it. 
#Nm14-24: But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it. 
#Nm14-25: Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. "" 
#Nm14-26: The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: 
#Nm14-27: "How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites. 
#Nm14-28: So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say: 
#Nm14-29: In this wilderness your bodies will fall —every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me. 
#Nm14-30: Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
#Nm14-31: As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected. 
#Nm14-32: But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. 
#Nm14-33: Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. 
#Nm14-34: For forty years —one year for each of the forty days you explored the land —you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.' 
#Nm14-35: I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die." 
#Nm14-36: So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it — 
#Nm14-37: these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the LORD. 
#Nm14-38: Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived. 
#Nm14-39: When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly. 
#Nm14-40: Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, "Now we are ready to go up to the land the LORD promised. Surely we have sinned!" 
#Nm14-41: But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying the LORD's command? This will not succeed! 
#Nm14-42: Do not go up, because the LORD is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies, 
#Nm14-43: for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the LORD, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword." 
#Nm14-44: Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the LORD's covenant moved from the camp. 
#Nm14-45: Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
 NÚMEROS 15
#Nm15-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm15-2: "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'After you enter the land I am giving you as a home 
#Nm15-3: and you present to the LORD offerings made by fire, from the herd or the flock, as an aroma pleasing to the LORD -whether burnt offerings or sacrifices, for special vows or freewill offerings or festival offerings- 
#Nm15-4: then the one who brings his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil. 
#Nm15-5: With each lamb for the burnt offering or the sacrifice, prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering. 
#Nm15-6: "'With a ram prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil, 
#Nm15-7: and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 
#Nm15-8: "'When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, for a special vow or a fellowship offering to the LORD, 
#Nm15-9: bring with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil. 
#Nm15-10: Also bring half a hin of wine as a drink offering. It will be an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 
#Nm15-11: Each bull or ram, each lamb or young goat, is to be prepared in this manner. 
#Nm15-12: Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare. 
#Nm15-13: "'Everyone who is native-born must do these things in this way when he brings an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 
#Nm15-14: For the generations to come, whenever an alien or anyone else living among you presents an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, he must do exactly as you do. 
#Nm15-15: The community is to have the same rules for you and for the alien living among you; this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. You and the alien shall be the same before the LORD: 
#Nm15-16: The same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the alien living among you.'" 
#Nm15-17: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm15-18: "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When you enter the land to which I am taking you 
#Nm15-19: and you eat the food of the land, present a portion as an offering to the LORD. 
#Nm15-20: Present a cake from the first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the threshing floor. 
#Nm15-21: Throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the LORD from the first of your ground meal. 
#Nm15-22: "'Now if you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the LORD gave Moses- 
#Nm15-23: any of the LORD's commands to you through him, from the day the LORD gave them and continuing through the generations to come- 
#Nm15-24: and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it, then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering. 
#Nm15-25: The priest is to make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and they will be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have brought to the LORD for their wrong an offering made by fire and a sin offering. 
#Nm15-26: The whole Israelite community and the aliens living among them will be forgiven, because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong. 
#Nm15-27: "'But if just one person sins unintentionally, he must bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering. 
#Nm15-28: The priest is to make atonement before the LORD for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally, and when atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven. 
#Nm15-29: One and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether he is a native-born Israelite or an alien. 
#Nm15-30: "'But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or alien, blasphemes the LORD, and that person must be cut off from his people. 
#Nm15-31: Because he has despised the LORD's word and broken his commands, that person must surely be cut off; his guilt remains on him.'" 
#Nm15-32: While the Israelites were in the desert, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day. 
#Nm15-33: Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly, 
#Nm15-34: and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him. 
#Nm15-35: Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp." 
#Nm15-36: So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Nm15-37: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm15-38: "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'Throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments, with a blue cord on each tassel. 
#Nm15-39: You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the LORD, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by going after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes. 
#Nm15-40: Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God. 
#Nm15-41: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.'"
 NÚMEROS 16
#Nm16-1: Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites —Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth —became insolent [^1] 
#Nm16-2: and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council. 
#Nm16-3: They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD's assembly?" 
#Nm16-4: When Moses heard this, he fell facedown. 
#Nm16-5: Then he said to Korah and all his followers: "In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him. 
#Nm16-6: You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers 
#Nm16-7: and tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them before the LORD. The man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!" 
#Nm16-8: Moses also said to Korah, "Now listen, you Levites! 
#Nm16-9: Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD's tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them? 
#Nm16-10: He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too. 
#Nm16-11: It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?" 
#Nm16-12: Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come! 
#Nm16-13: Isn't it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it over us! 
#Nm16-14: Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you want to treat these men like slaves "? No, we will not come!" 
#Nm16-15: Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them." 
#Nm16-16: Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow —you and they and Aaron. 
#Nm16-17: Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it —250 censers in all —and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also." 
#Nm16-18: So each of them took his censer, put burning coals and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
#Nm16-19: When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly. 
#Nm16-20: The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
#Nm16-21: "Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." 
#Nm16-22: But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?" 
#Nm16-23: Then the LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm16-24: "Say to the assembly, 'Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'" 
#Nm16-25: Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. 
#Nm16-26: He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins." 
#Nm16-27: So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents. 
#Nm16-28: Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea: 
#Nm16-29: If these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind, then the LORD has not sent me. 
#Nm16-30: But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt." 
#Nm16-31: As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart 
#Nm16-32: and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions. 
#Nm16-33: They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community. 
#Nm16-34: At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!" 
#Nm16-35: And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense. 
#Nm16-36: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm16-37: "Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy — 
#Nm16-38: the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites." 
#Nm16-39: So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar, 
#Nm16-40: as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers. 
#Nm16-41: The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the LORD's people," they said. 
#Nm16-42: But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared. 
#Nm16-43: Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting, 
#Nm16-44: and the LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm16-45: "Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." And they fell facedown. 
#Nm16-46: Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put incense in it, along with burning coals from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started." 
#Nm16-47: So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them. 
#Nm16-48: He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped. 
#Nm16-49: But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah. 
#Nm16-50: Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped. [^3]
 NÚMEROS 17
#Nm17-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm17-2: "Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff. 
#Nm17-3: On the staff of Levi write Aaron's name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe. 
#Nm17-4: Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law, where I meet with you. 
#Nm17-5: The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites." 
#Nm17-6: So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron's staff was among them. 
#Nm17-7: Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the covenant law. 
#Nm17-8: The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron's staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds. 
#Nm17-9: Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD's presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each of the leaders took his own staff. 
#Nm17-10: The LORD said to Moses, "Put back Aaron's staff in front of the ark of the covenant law, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die." 
#Nm17-11: Moses did just as the LORD commanded him. 
#Nm17-12: The Israelites said to Moses, "We will die! We are lost, we are all lost! 
#Nm17-13: Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to die?"
 NÚMEROS 18
#Nm18-1: The LORD said to Aaron, "You, your sons and your family are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the sanctuary, and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses connected with the priesthood. 
#Nm18-2: Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the tent of the covenant law. 
#Nm18-3: They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar. Otherwise both they and you will die. 
#Nm18-4: They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting —all the work at the tent —and no one else may come near where you are. 
#Nm18-5: "You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again. 
#Nm18-6: I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to do the work at the tent of meeting. 
#Nm18-7: But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary is to be put to death." 
#Nm18-8: Then the LORD said to Aaron, "I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion, your perpetual share. 
#Nm18-9: You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin "or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons. 
#Nm18-10: Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy. 
#Nm18-11: "This also is yours: whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it. 
#Nm18-12: "I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the LORD as the firstfruits of their harvest. 
#Nm18-13: All the land's firstfruits that they bring to the LORD will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it. 
#Nm18-14: "Everything in Israel that is devoted "to the LORD is yours. 
#Nm18-15: The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered to the LORD is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals. 
#Nm18-16: When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels "of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. 
#Nm18-17: "But you must not redeem the firstborn of a cow, a sheep or a goat; they are holy. Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 
#Nm18-18: Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours. 
#Nm18-19: Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the LORD I give to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD for both you and your offspring." 
#Nm18-20: The LORD said to Aaron, "You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites. 
#Nm18-21: "I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting. 
#Nm18-22: From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die. 
#Nm18-23: It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for any offenses they commit against it. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites. 
#Nm18-24: Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the LORD. That is why I said concerning them: 'They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.'" 
#Nm18-25: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm18-26: "Speak to the Levites and say to them: 'When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the LORD's offering. 
#Nm18-27: Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress. 
#Nm18-28: In this way you also will present an offering to the LORD from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes you must give the LORD's portion to Aaron the priest. 
#Nm18-29: You must present as the LORD's portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you.' 
#Nm18-30: "Say to the Levites: 'When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress. 
#Nm18-31: You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages for your work at the tent of meeting. 
#Nm18-32: By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.'"
 NÚMEROS 19
#Nm19-1: The LORD said to Moses and Aaron: 
#Nm19-2: "This is a requirement of the law that the LORD has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke. 
#Nm19-3: Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence. 
#Nm19-4: Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting. 
#Nm19-5: While he watches, the heifer is to be burned —its hide, flesh, blood and intestines. 
#Nm19-6: The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer. 
#Nm19-7: After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening. 
#Nm19-8: The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he too will be unclean till evening. 
#Nm19-9: "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They are to be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin. 
#Nm19-10: The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them. 
#Nm19-11: "Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days. 
#Nm19-12: They must purify themselves with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on the third and seventh days, they will not be clean. 
#Nm19-13: If they fail to purify themselves after touching a human corpse, they defile the LORD's tabernacle. They must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, they are unclean; their uncleanness remains on them. 
#Nm19-14: "This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent: Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days, 
#Nm19-15: and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean. 
#Nm19-16: "Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days. 
#Nm19-17: "For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them. 
#Nm19-18: Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or anyone who has been killed or anyone who has died a natural death. 
#Nm19-19: The man who is clean is to sprinkle those who are unclean on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify them. Those who are being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and that evening they will be clean. 
#Nm19-20: But if those who are unclean do not purify themselves, they must be cut off from the community, because they have defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them, and they are unclean. 
#Nm19-21: This is a lasting ordinance for them. "The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening. 
#Nm19-22: Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening."
 NÚMEROS 20
#Nm20-1: In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. 
#Nm20-2: Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron. 
#Nm20-3: They quarreled with Moses and said, "If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the LORD! 
#Nm20-4: Why did you bring the LORD's community into this wilderness, that we and our livestock should die here? 
#Nm20-5: Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!" 
#Nm20-6: Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them. 
#Nm20-7: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm20-8: "Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink." 
#Nm20-9: So Moses took the staff from the LORD's presence, just as he commanded him. 
#Nm20-10: He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, "Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?" 
#Nm20-11: Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank. 
#Nm20-12: But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them." 
#Nm20-13: These were the waters of Meribah, "where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD and where he was proved holy among them. 
#Nm20-14: Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: "This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come on us. 
#Nm20-15: Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors, 
#Nm20-16: but when we cried out to the LORD, he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. "Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory. 
#Nm20-17: Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King's Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory." 
#Nm20-18: But Edom answered: "You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword." 
#Nm20-19: The Israelites replied: "We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot —nothing else." 
#Nm20-20: Again they answered: "You may not pass through." Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army. 
#Nm20-21: Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them. 
#Nm20-22: The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. 
#Nm20-23: At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
#Nm20-24: "Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah. 
#Nm20-25: Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor. 
#Nm20-26: Remove Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there." 
#Nm20-27: Moses did as the LORD commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community. 
#Nm20-28: Moses removed Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain, 
#Nm20-29: and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, all the Israelites mourned for him thirty days.
 NÚMEROS 21
#Nm21-1: When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them. 
#Nm21-2: Then Israel made this vow to the LORD: "If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy "their cities." 
#Nm21-3: The LORD listened to Israel's plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah. [^2] 
#Nm21-4: They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, "to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way; 
#Nm21-5: they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!" 
#Nm21-6: Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died. 
#Nm21-7: The people came to Moses and said, "We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us." So Moses prayed for the people. 
#Nm21-8: The LORD said to Moses, "Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live." 
#Nm21-9: So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived. 
#Nm21-10: The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth. 
#Nm21-11: Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab toward the sunrise. 
#Nm21-12: From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley. 
#Nm21-13: They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
#Nm21-14: That is why the Book of the Wars of the LORD says: ". . . Zahab "in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon 
#Nm21-15: and "the slopes of the ravines that lead to the settlement of Ar and lie along the border of Moab." 
#Nm21-16: From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Gather the people together and I will give them water." 
#Nm21-17: Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up, O well! Sing about it, 
#Nm21-18: about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank — the nobles with scepters and staffs." Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah, 
#Nm21-19: from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
#Nm21-20: and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland. 
#Nm21-21: Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites: 
#Nm21-22: "Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King's Highway until we have passed through your territory." 
#Nm21-23: But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the wilderness against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel. 
#Nm21-24: Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified. 
#Nm21-25: Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements. 
#Nm21-26: Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon. 
#Nm21-27: That is why the poets say: "Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon's city be restored. 
#Nm21-28: "Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon's heights. 
#Nm21-29: Woe to you, Moab! You are destroyed, people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites. 
#Nm21-30: "But we have overthrown them; Heshbon's dominion has been destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba." 
#Nm21-31: So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites. 
#Nm21-32: After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
#Nm21-33: Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei. 
#Nm21-34: The LORD said to Moses, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon." 
#Nm21-35: So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.
 NÚMEROS 22
#Nm22-1: Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho. 
#Nm22-2: Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, 
#Nm22-3: and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites. 
#Nm22-4: The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field." So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, 
#Nm22-5: sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the Euphrates River, in his native land. Balak said: "A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. 
#Nm22-6: Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed." 
#Nm22-7: The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said. 
#Nm22-8: "Spend the night here," Balaam said to them, "and I will report back to you with the answer the LORD gives me." So the Moabite officials stayed with him. 
#Nm22-9: God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?" 
#Nm22-10: Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: 
#Nm22-11: 'A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.'" 
#Nm22-12: But God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed." 
#Nm22-13: The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak's officials, "Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you." 
#Nm22-14: So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, "Balaam refused to come with us." 
#Nm22-15: Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first. 
#Nm22-16: They came to Balaam and said: "This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me, 
#Nm22-17: because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me." 
#Nm22-18: But Balaam answered them, "Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the LORD my God. 
#Nm22-19: Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the LORD will tell me." 
#Nm22-20: That night God came to Balaam and said, "Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you." 
#Nm22-21: Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials. 
#Nm22-22: But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
#Nm22-23: When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road. 
#Nm22-24: Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides. 
#Nm22-25: When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat the donkey again. 
#Nm22-26: Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left. 
#Nm22-27: When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff. 
#Nm22-28: Then the LORD opened the donkey's mouth, and it said to Balaam, "What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?" 
#Nm22-29: Balaam answered the donkey, "You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now." 
#Nm22-30: The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?" "No," he said. 
#Nm22-31: Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown. 
#Nm22-32: The angel of the LORD asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me. [^1] 
#Nm22-33: The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it." 
#Nm22-34: Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back." 
#Nm22-35: The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you." So Balaam went with Balak's officials. 
#Nm22-36: When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. 
#Nm22-37: Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?" 
#Nm22-38: "Well, I have come to you now," Balaam replied. "But I can't say whatever I please. I must speak only what God puts in my mouth." 
#Nm22-39: Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth. 
#Nm22-40: Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him. 
#Nm22-41: The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp.
 NÚMEROS 23
#Nm23-1: Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me." 
#Nm23-2: Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
#Nm23-3: Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you." Then he went off to a barren height. 
#Nm23-4: God met with him, and Balaam said, "I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram." 
#Nm23-5: The LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this word." 
#Nm23-6: So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the Moabite officials. 
#Nm23-7: Then Balaam spoke his message: "Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. 'Come,' he said, 'curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.' 
#Nm23-8: How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced? 
#Nm23-9: From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations. 
#Nm23-10: Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my final end be like theirs!" 
#Nm23-11: Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!" 
#Nm23-12: He answered, "Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?" 
#Nm23-13: Then Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp. And from there, curse them for me." 
#Nm23-14: So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
#Nm23-15: Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there." 
#Nm23-16: The LORD met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this word." 
#Nm23-17: So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the Moabite officials. Balak asked him, "What did the LORD say?" 
#Nm23-18: Then he spoke his message: "Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor. 
#Nm23-19: God is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill? 
#Nm23-20: I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it. 
#Nm23-21: "No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed "in Israel. The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them. 
#Nm23-22: God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. 
#Nm23-23: There is no divination against "Jacob, no evil omens against "Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what God has done!' 
#Nm23-24: The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims." 
#Nm23-25: Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!" 
#Nm23-26: Balaam answered, "Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?" 
#Nm23-27: Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there." 
#Nm23-28: And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland. 
#Nm23-29: Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me." 
#Nm23-30: Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
 NÚMEROS 24
#Nm24-1: Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to divination as at other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness. 
#Nm24-2: When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him 
#Nm24-3: and he spoke his message: "The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly, 
#Nm24-4: the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, "who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: 
#Nm24-5: "How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, your dwelling places, Israel! 
#Nm24-6: "Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters. 
#Nm24-7: Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. "Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted. 
#Nm24-8: "God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them. 
#Nm24-9: Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness —who dares to rouse them? "May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!" 
#Nm24-10: Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times. 
#Nm24-11: Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded." 
#Nm24-12: Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, 
#Nm24-13: 'Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD —and I must say only what the LORD says'? 
#Nm24-14: Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come." 
#Nm24-15: Then he spoke his message: "The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly, 
#Nm24-16: the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: 
#Nm24-17: "I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls "of "all the people of Sheth. [^4] 
#Nm24-18: Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong. 
#Nm24-19: A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city." 
#Nm24-20: Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message: "Amalek was first among the nations, but their end will be utter destruction." 
#Nm24-21: Then he saw the Kenites and spoke his message: "Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock; 
#Nm24-22: yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Ashur takes you captive." 
#Nm24-23: Then he spoke his message: "Alas! Who can live when God does this? [^5] 
#Nm24-24: Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus; they will subdue Ashur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin." 
#Nm24-25: Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way.
 NÚMEROS 25
#Nm25-1: While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women, 
#Nm25-2: who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate the sacrificial meal and bowed down before these gods. 
#Nm25-3: So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the LORD's anger burned against them. 
#Nm25-4: The LORD said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the LORD's fierce anger may turn away from Israel." 
#Nm25-5: So Moses said to Israel's judges, "Each of you must put to death those of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor." 
#Nm25-6: Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
#Nm25-7: When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand 
#Nm25-8: and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman's stomach. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped; 
#Nm25-9: but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000. 
#Nm25-10: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm25-11: "Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal. 
#Nm25-12: Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him. 
#Nm25-13: He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites." 
#Nm25-14: The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family. 
#Nm25-15: And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Kozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family. 
#Nm25-16: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm25-17: "Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them. 
#Nm25-18: They treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the Peor incident involving their sister Kozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of that incident."
 NÚMEROS 26
#Nm26-1: After the plague the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, 
#Nm26-2: "Take a census of the whole Israelite community by families —all those twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel." 
#Nm26-3: So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them and said, 
#Nm26-4: "Take a census of the men twenty years old or more, as the LORD commanded Moses." These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt: 
#Nm26-5: The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were: through Hanok, the Hanokite clan; through Pallu, the Palluite clan; 
#Nm26-6: through Hezron, the Hezronite clan; through Karmi, the Karmite clan. 
#Nm26-7: These were the clans of Reuben; those numbered were 43,730. 
#Nm26-8: The son of Pallu was Eliab, 
#Nm26-9: and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. The same Dathan and Abiram were the community officials who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and were among Korah's followers when they rebelled against the LORD. 
#Nm26-10: The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire devoured the 250 men. And they served as a warning sign. 
#Nm26-11: The line of Korah, however, did not die out. 
#Nm26-12: The descendants of Simeon by their clans were: through Nemuel, the Nemuelite clan; through Jamin, the Jaminite clan; through Jakin, the Jakinite clan;

#Nm26-34: These were the clans of Manasseh; those numbered were 52,700.

#Nm26-45: and through the descendants of Beriah: through Heber, the Heberite clan; through Malkiel, the Malkielite clan. 
#Nm26-46: (Asher had a daughter named Serah.) 
#Nm26-47: These were the clans of Asher; those numbered were 53,400. 
#Nm26-48: The descendants of Naphtali by their clans were: through Jahzeel, the Jahzeelite clan; through Guni, the Gunite clan; 
#Nm26-49: through Jezer, the Jezerite clan; through Shillem, the Shillemite clan. 
#Nm26-50: These were the clans of Naphtali; those numbered were 45,400. 
#Nm26-51: The total number of the men of Israel was 601,730. 
#Nm26-52: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm26-53: "The land is to be allotted to them as an inheritance based on the number of names. 
#Nm26-54: To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one; each is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those listed. 
#Nm26-55: Be sure that the land is distributed by lot. What each group inherits will be according to the names for its ancestral tribe. 
#Nm26-56: Each inheritance is to be distributed by lot among the larger and smaller groups." 
#Nm26-57: These were the Levites who were counted by their clans: through Gershon, the Gershonite clan; through Kohath, the Kohathite clan; through Merari, the Merarite clan. 
#Nm26-58: These also were Levite clans: the Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, the Korahite clan. (Kohath was the forefather of Amram; 
#Nm26-59: the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who was born to the Levites "in Egypt. To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses and their sister Miriam. 
#Nm26-60: Aaron was the father of Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
#Nm26-61: But Nadab and Abihu died when they made an offering before the LORD with unauthorized fire.) 
#Nm26-62: All the male Levites a month old or more numbered 23,000. They were not counted along with the other Israelites because they received no inheritance among them. 
#Nm26-63: These are the ones counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they counted the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho. 
#Nm26-64: Not one of them was among those counted by Moses and Aaron the priest when they counted the Israelites in the Desert of Sinai. 
#Nm26-65: For the LORD had told those Israelites they would surely die in the wilderness, and not one of them was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
 NÚMEROS 27
#Nm27-1: The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah. They came forward 
#Nm27-2: and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders and the whole assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said, 
#Nm27-3: "Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among Korah's followers, who banded together against the LORD, but he died for his own sin and left no sons. 
#Nm27-4: Why should our father's name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father's relatives." 
#Nm27-5: So Moses brought their case before the LORD, 
#Nm27-6: and the LORD said to him, 
#Nm27-7: "What Zelophehad's daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father's relatives and give their father's inheritance to them. 
#Nm27-8: "Say to the Israelites, 'If a man dies and leaves no son, give his inheritance to his daughter. 
#Nm27-9: If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers. 
#Nm27-10: If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father's brothers. 
#Nm27-11: If his father had no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, that he may possess it. This is to have the force of law for the Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses.'" 
#Nm27-12: Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go up this mountain in the Abarim Range and see the land I have given the Israelites. 
#Nm27-13: After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was, 
#Nm27-14: for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes." (These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.) 
#Nm27-15: Moses said to the LORD, 
#Nm27-16: "May the LORD, the God who gives breath to all living things, appoint someone over this community 
#Nm27-17: to go out and come in before them, one who will lead them out and bring them in, so the LORD's people will not be like sheep without a shepherd." 
#Nm27-18: So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit of leadership, "and lay your hand on him. 
#Nm27-19: Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence. 
#Nm27-20: Give him some of your authority so the whole Israelite community will obey him. 
#Nm27-21: He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the LORD. At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in." 
#Nm27-22: Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly. 
#Nm27-23: Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the LORD instructed through Moses.
 NÚMEROS 28
#Nm28-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm28-2: "Give this command to the Israelites and say to them: 'Make sure that you present to me at the appointed time my food offerings, as an aroma pleasing to me.' 
#Nm28-3: Say to them: 'This is the food offering you are to present to the LORD: two lambs a year old without defect, as a regular burnt offering each day. 
#Nm28-4: Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight, 
#Nm28-5: together with a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah "of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin "of oil from pressed olives. 
#Nm28-6: This is the regular burnt offering instituted at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD. 
#Nm28-7: The accompanying drink offering is to be a quarter of a hin of fermented drink with each lamb. Pour out the drink offering to the LORD at the sanctuary. 
#Nm28-8: Offer the second lamb at twilight, along with the same kind of grain offering and drink offering that you offer in the morning. This is a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the LORD. 
#Nm28-9: "'On the Sabbath day, make an offering of two lambs a year old without defect, together with its drink offering and a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah "of the finest flour mixed with olive oil. 
#Nm28-10: This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering. 
#Nm28-11: "'On the first of every month, present to the LORD a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect. 
#Nm28-12: With each bull there is to be a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah "of the finest flour mixed with oil; with the ram, a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil; 
#Nm28-13: and with each lamb, a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil. This is for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the LORD. 
#Nm28-14: With each bull there is to be a drink offering of half a hin "of wine; with the ram, a third of a hin "; and with each lamb, a quarter of a hin. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon during the year. 
#Nm28-15: Besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering, one male goat is to be presented to the LORD as a sin offering. [^7] 
#Nm28-16: "'On the fourteenth day of the first month the LORD's Passover is to be held. 
#Nm28-17: On the fifteenth day of this month there is to be a festival; for seven days eat bread made without yeast. 
#Nm28-18: On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.

#Nm28-22: Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 
#Nm28-23: Offer these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering. 
#Nm28-24: In this way present the food offering every day for seven days as an aroma pleasing to the LORD; it is to be offered in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering. 
#Nm28-25: On the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. 
#Nm28-26: "'On the day of firstfruits, when you present to the LORD an offering of new grain during the Festival of Weeks, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.

 NÚMEROS 30
#Nm30-1: Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel: "This is what the LORD commands: 
#Nm30-2: When a man makes a vow to the LORD or takes an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he must not break his word but must do everything he said. 
#Nm30-3: "When a young woman still living in her father's household makes a vow to the LORD or obligates herself by a pledge 
#Nm30-4: and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, then all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will stand. 
#Nm30-5: But if her father forbids her when he hears about it, none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand; the LORD will release her because her father has forbidden her. 
#Nm30-6: "If she marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise by which she obligates herself 
#Nm30-7: and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her, then her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand. 
#Nm30-8: But if her husband forbids her when he hears about it, he nullifies the vow that obligates her or the rash promise by which she obligates herself, and the LORD will release her. 
#Nm30-9: "Any vow or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding on her. 
#Nm30-10: "If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates herself by a pledge under oath 
#Nm30-11: and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her and does not forbid her, then all her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand. 
#Nm30-12: But if her husband nullifies them when he hears about them, then none of the vows or pledges that came from her lips will stand. Her husband has nullified them, and the LORD will release her. 
#Nm30-13: Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself. [^2] 
#Nm30-14: But if her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her when he hears about them. 
#Nm30-15: If, however, he nullifies them some time after he hears about them, then he must bear the consequences of her wrongdoing." 
#Nm30-16: These are the regulations the LORD gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife, and between a father and his young daughter still living at home.
 NÚMEROS 31
#Nm31-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm31-2: "Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people." 
#Nm31-3: So Moses said to the people, "Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites so that they may carry out the LORD's vengeance on them. 
#Nm31-4: Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel." 
#Nm31-5: So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel. 
#Nm31-6: Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling. 
#Nm31-7: They fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every man. 
#Nm31-8: Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba —the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. 
#Nm31-9: The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. 
#Nm31-10: They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps. 
#Nm31-11: They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals, 
#Nm31-12: and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho. 
#Nm31-13: Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp. 
#Nm31-14: Moses was angry with the officers of the army —the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds —who returned from the battle. 
#Nm31-15: "Have you allowed all the women to live?" he asked them. 
#Nm31-16: "They were the ones who followed Balaam's advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the LORD in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the LORD's people. 
#Nm31-17: Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, 
#Nm31-18: but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man. 
#Nm31-19: "Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives. 
#Nm31-20: Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood." 
#Nm31-21: Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, "This is what is required by the law that the LORD gave Moses: 
#Nm31-22: Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead 
#Nm31-23: and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water. 
#Nm31-24: On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp." 
#Nm31-25: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm31-26: "You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured. 
#Nm31-27: Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community. 
#Nm31-28: From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the LORD one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys or sheep. 
#Nm31-29: Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part. 
#Nm31-30: From the Israelites' half, select one out of every fifty, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle." 
#Nm31-31: So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Nm31-32: The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep, 
#Nm31-33: 72,000 cattle, 
#Nm31-34: 61,000 donkeys 
#Nm31-35: and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man. 
#Nm31-36: The half share of those who fought in the battle was: 337,500 sheep, 
#Nm31-37: of which the tribute for the LORD was 675; 
#Nm31-38: 36,000 cattle, of which the tribute for the LORD was 72; 
#Nm31-39: 30,500 donkeys, of which the tribute for the LORD was 61; 
#Nm31-40: 16,000 people, of whom the tribute for the LORD was 32. 
#Nm31-41: Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Nm31-42: The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men — 
#Nm31-43: the community's half —was 337,500 sheep, 
#Nm31-44: 36,000 cattle, 
#Nm31-45: 30,500 donkeys 
#Nm31-46: and 16,000 people. 
#Nm31-47: From the Israelites' half, Moses selected one out of every fifty people and animals, as the LORD commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle. 
#Nm31-48: Then the officers who were over the units of the army —the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds —went to Moses 
#Nm31-49: and said to him, "Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing. 
#Nm31-50: So we have brought as an offering to the LORD the gold articles each of us acquired —armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces —to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD." 
#Nm31-51: Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold —all the crafted articles. 
#Nm31-52: All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the LORD weighed 16,750 shekels. [^1] 
#Nm31-53: Each soldier had taken plunder for himself. 
#Nm31-54: Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
 NÚMEROS 32
#Nm32-1: The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock. 
#Nm32-2: So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said, 
#Nm32-3: "Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon — 
#Nm32-4: the land the LORD subdued before the people of Israel —are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock. 
#Nm32-5: If we have found favor in your eyes," they said, "let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan." 
#Nm32-6: Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, "Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here? 
#Nm32-7: Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the LORD has given them? 
#Nm32-8: This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land. 
#Nm32-9: After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them. 
#Nm32-10: The LORD's anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath: 
#Nm32-11: 'Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of those who were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob — 
#Nm32-12: not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the LORD wholeheartedly.' 
#Nm32-13: The LORD's anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone. 
#Nm32-14: "And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the LORD even more angry with Israel. 
#Nm32-15: If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction." 
#Nm32-16: Then they came up to him and said, "We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children. 
#Nm32-17: But we will arm ourselves for battle "and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land. 
#Nm32-18: We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their inheritance. 
#Nm32-19: We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan." 
#Nm32-20: Then Moses said to them, "If you will do this —if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle 
#Nm32-21: and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the LORD until he has driven his enemies out before him — 
#Nm32-22: then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free from your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the LORD. 
#Nm32-23: "But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the LORD; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out. 
#Nm32-24: Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised." 
#Nm32-25: The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, "We your servants will do as our lord commands. 
#Nm32-26: Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead. 
#Nm32-27: But your servants, every man who is armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD, just as our lord says." 
#Nm32-28: Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes. 
#Nm32-29: He said to them, "If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued before you, you must give them the land of Gilead as their possession. 
#Nm32-30: But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan." 
#Nm32-31: The Gadites and Reubenites answered, "Your servants will do what the LORD has said. 
#Nm32-32: We will cross over before the LORD into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan." 
#Nm32-33: Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan —the whole land with its cities and the territory around them. 
#Nm32-34: The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
#Nm32-35: Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
#Nm32-36: Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks. 
#Nm32-37: And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim, 
#Nm32-38: as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt. 
#Nm32-39: The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
#Nm32-40: So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there. 
#Nm32-41: Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair. [^2] 
#Nm32-42: And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.

#Nm33-1: Here are the stages in the journey of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. 
#Nm33-2: At the LORD's command Moses recorded the stages in their journey. This is their journey by stages: 
#Nm33-3: The Israelites set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover. They marched out defiantly in full view of all the Egyptians, 
#Nm33-4: who were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them; for the LORD had brought judgment on their gods. 
#Nm33-5: The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Sukkoth. 
#Nm33-6: They left Sukkoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the desert. 
#Nm33-7: They left Etham, turned back to Pi Hahiroth, to the east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol. 
#Nm33-8: They left Pi Hahiroth "and passed through the sea into the desert, and when they had traveled for three days in the Desert of Etham, they camped at Marah. 
#Nm33-9: They left Marah and went to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there. 
#Nm33-10: They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea. [^2]

#Nm33-15: They left Rephidim and camped in the Desert of Sinai. 
#Nm33-16: They left the Desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah. 
#Nm33-17: They left Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth. 
#Nm33-18: They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.

#Nm33-22: They left Rissah and camped at Kehelathah. 
#Nm33-23: They left Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher. 
#Nm33-24: They left Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah. 
#Nm33-25: They left Haradah and camped at Makheloth. 
#Nm33-26: They left Makheloth and camped at Tahath. 
#Nm33-27: They left Tahath and camped at Terah.

#Nm33-29: They left Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah. 
#Nm33-30: They left Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth. 
#Nm33-31: They left Moseroth and camped at Bene Jaakan. 
#Nm33-32: They left Bene Jaakan and camped at Hor Haggidgad. 
#Nm33-33: They left Hor Haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah. 
#Nm33-34: They left Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. 
#Nm33-35: They left Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber. 
#Nm33-36: They left Ezion Geber and camped at Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin. 
#Nm33-37: They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the border of Edom. 
#Nm33-38: At the LORD's command Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor, where he died on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. 
#Nm33-39: Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. 
#Nm33-40: The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming. 
#Nm33-41: They left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.

#Nm33-50: On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho the LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm33-51: "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, 
#Nm33-52: drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images and their cast idols, and demolish all their high places. 
#Nm33-53: Take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess. 
#Nm33-54: Distribute the land by lot, according to your clans. To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one. Whatever falls to them by lot will be theirs. Distribute it according to your ancestral tribes. 
#Nm33-55: "'But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land where you will live. 
#Nm33-56: And then I will do to you what I plan to do to them.'"
 NÚMEROS 34
#Nm34-1: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm34-2: "Command the Israelites and say to them: 'When you enter Canaan, the land that will be allotted to you as an inheritance is to have these boundaries: 
#Nm34-3: "'Your southern side will include some of the Desert of Zin along the border of Edom. Your southern boundary will start in the east from the southern end of the Dead Sea, 
#Nm34-4: cross south of Scorpion Pass, continue on to Zin and go south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon, 
#Nm34-5: where it will turn, join the Wadi of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean Sea. 
#Nm34-6: "'Your western boundary will be the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This will be your boundary on the west. 
#Nm34-7: "'For your northern boundary, run a line from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor 
#Nm34-8: and from Mount Hor to Lebo Hamath. Then the boundary will go to Zedad, 
#Nm34-9: continue to Ziphron and end at Hazar Enan. This will be your boundary on the north. 
#Nm34-10: "'For your eastern boundary, run a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham. 
#Nm34-11: The boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Galilee. [^1] 
#Nm34-12: Then the boundary will go down along the Jordan and end at the Dead Sea. "'This will be your land, with its boundaries on every side.'" 
#Nm34-13: Moses commanded the Israelites: "Assign this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has ordered that it be given to the nine and a half tribes, 
#Nm34-14: because the families of the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance. 
#Nm34-15: These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance east of the Jordan across from Jericho, toward the sunrise." 
#Nm34-16: The LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm34-17: "These are the names of the men who are to assign the land for you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun. 
#Nm34-18: And appoint one leader from each tribe to help assign the land. 
#Nm34-19: These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah; 
#Nm34-20: Shemuel son of Ammihud, from the tribe of Simeon; 
#Nm34-21: Elidad son of Kislon, from the tribe of Benjamin; 
#Nm34-22: Bukki son of Jogli, the leader from the tribe of Dan; 
#Nm34-23: Hanniel son of Ephod, the leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph; 
#Nm34-24: Kemuel son of Shiphtan, the leader from the tribe of Ephraim son of Joseph; 
#Nm34-25: Elizaphan son of Parnak, the leader from the tribe of Zebulun; 
#Nm34-26: Paltiel son of Azzan, the leader from the tribe of Issachar; 
#Nm34-27: Ahihud son of Shelomi, the leader from the tribe of Asher; 
#Nm34-28: Pedahel son of Ammihud, the leader from the tribe of Naphtali." 
#Nm34-29: These are the men the LORD commanded to assign the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
 NÚMEROS 35
#Nm35-1: On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses, 
#Nm35-2: "Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. And give them pasturelands around the towns. 
#Nm35-3: Then they will have towns to live in and pasturelands for the cattle they own and all their other animals. 
#Nm35-4: "The pasturelands around the towns that you give the Levites will extend a thousand cubits "from the town wall. 
#Nm35-5: Outside the town, measure two thousand cubits "on the east side, two thousand on the south side, two thousand on the west and two thousand on the north, with the town in the center. They will have this area as pastureland for the towns. 
#Nm35-6: "Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone may flee. In addition, give them forty-two other towns. 
#Nm35-7: In all you must give the Levites forty-eight towns, together with their pasturelands. 
#Nm35-8: The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: Take many towns from a tribe that has many, but few from one that has few." 
#Nm35-9: Then the LORD said to Moses: 
#Nm35-10: "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, 
#Nm35-11: select some towns to be your cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone accidentally may flee. 
#Nm35-12: They will be places of refuge from the avenger, so that anyone accused of murder may not die before they stand trial before the assembly. 
#Nm35-13: These six towns you give will be your cities of refuge. 
#Nm35-14: Give three on this side of the Jordan and three in Canaan as cities of refuge. 
#Nm35-15: These six towns will be a place of refuge for Israelites and for foreigners residing among them, so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there. 
#Nm35-16: "'If anyone strikes someone a fatal blow with an iron object, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death. 
#Nm35-17: Or if anyone is holding a stone and strikes someone a fatal blow with it, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death. 
#Nm35-18: Or if anyone is holding a wooden object and strikes someone a fatal blow with it, that person is a murderer; the murderer is to be put to death. 
#Nm35-19: The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death; when the avenger comes upon the murderer, the avenger shall put the murderer to death. 
#Nm35-20: If anyone with malice aforethought shoves another or throws something at them intentionally so that they die 
#Nm35-21: or if out of enmity one person hits another with their fist so that the other dies, that person is to be put to death; that person is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when they meet. 
#Nm35-22: "'But if without enmity someone suddenly pushes another or throws something at them unintentionally 
#Nm35-23: or, without seeing them, drops on them a stone heavy enough to kill them, and they die, then since that other person was not an enemy and no harm was intended, 
#Nm35-24: the assembly must judge between the accused and the avenger of blood according to these regulations. 
#Nm35-25: The assembly must protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood and send the accused back to the city of refuge to which they fled. The accused must stay there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. 
#Nm35-26: "'But if the accused ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which they fled 
#Nm35-27: and the avenger of blood finds them outside the city, the avenger of blood may kill the accused without being guilty of murder. 
#Nm35-28: The accused must stay in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest; only after the death of the high priest may they return to their own property. 
#Nm35-29: "'This is to have the force of law for you throughout the generations to come, wherever you live. 
#Nm35-30: "'Anyone who kills a person is to be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses. But no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 
#Nm35-31: "'Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer, who deserves to die. They are to be put to death. 
#Nm35-32: "'Do not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a city of refuge and so allow them to go back and live on their own land before the death of the high priest. 
#Nm35-33: "'Do not pollute the land where you are. Bloodshed pollutes the land, and atonement cannot be made for the land on which blood has been shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it. 
#Nm35-34: Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell, for I, the LORD, dwell among the Israelites.'"
 NÚMEROS 36
#Nm36-1: The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families. 
#Nm36-2: They said, "When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. 
#Nm36-3: Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away. 
#Nm36-4: When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors." 
#Nm36-5: Then at the LORD's command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: "What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right. 
#Nm36-6: This is what the LORD commands for Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father's tribal clan. 
#Nm36-7: No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors. 
#Nm36-8: Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father's tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors. 
#Nm36-9: No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits." 
#Nm36-10: So Zelophehad's daughters did as the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Nm36-11: Zelophehad's daughters —Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah —married their cousins on their father's side. 
#Nm36-12: They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father's tribe and clan. 
#Nm36-13: These are the commands and regulations the LORD gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.

 DEUTERONÔMIO 1
#Dt1-1: These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan —that is, in the Arabah —opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab. 
#Dt1-2: (It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.) 
#Dt1-3: In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them. 
#Dt1-4: This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. 
#Dt1-5: East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying: 
#Dt1-6: The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, "You have stayed long enough at this mountain. 
#Dt1-7: Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates. 
#Dt1-8: See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the LORD swore he would give to your fathers —to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob —and to their descendants after them." 
#Dt1-9: At that time I said to you, "You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone. 
#Dt1-10: The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky. 
#Dt1-11: May the LORD, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised! 
#Dt1-12: But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself? 
#Dt1-13: Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you." 
#Dt1-14: You answered me, "What you propose to do is good." 
#Dt1-15: So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you —as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials. 
#Dt1-16: And I charged your judges at that time, "Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you. 
#Dt1-17: Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it." 
#Dt1-18: And at that time I told you everything you were to do. 
#Dt1-19: Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea. 
#Dt1-20: Then I said to you, "You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us. 
#Dt1-21: See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged." 
#Dt1-22: Then all of you came to me and said, "Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to." 
#Dt1-23: The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe. 
#Dt1-24: They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it. 
#Dt1-25: Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, "It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us." 
#Dt1-26: But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. 
#Dt1-27: You grumbled in your tents and said, "The LORD hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us. 
#Dt1-28: Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, 'The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.'" 
#Dt1-29: Then I said to you, "Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them. 
#Dt1-30: The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes, 
#Dt1-31: and in the wilderness. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place." 
#Dt1-32: In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God, 
#Dt1-33: who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go. 
#Dt1-34: When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore: 
#Dt1-35: "No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors, 
#Dt1-36: except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly." 
#Dt1-37: Because of you the LORD became angry with me also and said, "You shall not enter it, either. 
#Dt1-38: But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it. 
#Dt1-39: And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad —they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it. 
#Dt1-40: But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. "" 
#Dt1-41: Then you replied, "We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us." So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country. 
#Dt1-42: But the LORD said to me, "Tell them, 'Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.'" 
#Dt1-43: So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD's command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country. 
#Dt1-44: The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah. 
#Dt1-45: You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you. 
#Dt1-46: And so you stayed in Kadesh many days —all the time you spent there.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 2
#Dt2-1: Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea, "as the LORD had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir. 
#Dt2-2: Then the LORD said to me, 
#Dt2-3: "You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north. 
#Dt2-4: Give the people these orders: 'You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful. 
#Dt2-5: Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own. 
#Dt2-6: You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.'" 
#Dt2-7: The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything. 
#Dt2-8: So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab. 
#Dt2-9: Then the LORD said to me, "Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession." 
#Dt2-10: (The Emites used to live there —a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. 
#Dt2-11: Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites. 
#Dt2-12: Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the LORD gave them as their possession.) 
#Dt2-13: And the LORD said, "Now get up and cross the Zered Valley." So we crossed the valley. 
#Dt2-14: Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them. 
#Dt2-15: The LORD's hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp. 
#Dt2-16: Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died, 
#Dt2-17: the LORD said to me, 
#Dt2-18: "Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar. 
#Dt2-19: When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot." 
#Dt2-20: (That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites. 
#Dt2-21: They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place. 
#Dt2-22: The LORD had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day. 
#Dt2-23: And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor "destroyed them and settled in their place.) 
#Dt2-24: "Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle. 
#Dt2-25: This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you." 
#Dt2-26: From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying, 
#Dt2-27: "Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left. 
#Dt2-28: Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot — 
#Dt2-29: as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us —until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us." 
#Dt2-30: But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done. 
#Dt2-31: The LORD said to me, "See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land." 
#Dt2-32: When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz, 
#Dt2-33: the LORD our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army. 
#Dt2-34: At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed "them —men, women and children. We left no survivors. 
#Dt2-35: But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves. 
#Dt2-36: From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them. 
#Dt2-37: But in accordance with the command of the LORD our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 3
#Dt3-1: Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei. 
#Dt3-2: The LORD said to me, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon." 
#Dt3-3: So the LORD our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors. 
#Dt3-4: At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them —the whole region of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan. 
#Dt3-5: All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages. 
#Dt3-6: We completely destroyed "them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying "every city —men, women and children. 
#Dt3-7: But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves. 
#Dt3-8: So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon. 
#Dt3-9: (Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.) 
#Dt3-10: We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan. 
#Dt3-11: (Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide. "It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.) 
#Dt3-12: Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns. 
#Dt3-13: The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites. 
#Dt3-14: Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair. ") 
#Dt3-15: And I gave Gilead to Makir. 
#Dt3-16: But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. 
#Dt3-17: Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah. 
#Dt3-18: I commanded you at that time: "The LORD your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of the other Israelites. 
#Dt3-19: However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you, 
#Dt3-20: until the LORD gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you." 
#Dt3-21: At that time I commanded Joshua: "You have seen with your own eyes all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going. 
#Dt3-22: Do not be afraid of them; the LORD your God himself will fight for you." 
#Dt3-23: At that time I pleaded with the LORD: 
#Dt3-24: "Sovereign LORD, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do? 
#Dt3-25: Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan —that fine hill country and Lebanon." 
#Dt3-26: But because of you the LORD was angry with me and would not listen to me. "That is enough," the LORD said. "Do not speak to me anymore about this matter. 
#Dt3-27: Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan. 
#Dt3-28: But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see." 
#Dt3-29: So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 4
#Dt4-1: Now, Israel, hear the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. 
#Dt4-2: Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you. 
#Dt4-3: You saw with your own eyes what the LORD did at Baal Peor. The LORD your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor, 
#Dt4-4: but all of you who held fast to the LORD your God are still alive today. 
#Dt4-5: See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the LORD my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it. 
#Dt4-6: Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people." 
#Dt4-7: What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the LORD our God is near us whenever we pray to him? 
#Dt4-8: And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today? 
#Dt4-9: Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them. 
#Dt4-10: Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when he said to me, "Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children." 
#Dt4-11: You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness. 
#Dt4-12: Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice. 
#Dt4-13: He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets. 
#Dt4-14: And the LORD directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. 
#Dt4-15: You saw no form of any kind the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully, 
#Dt4-16: so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman, 
#Dt4-17: or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air, 
#Dt4-18: or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below. 
#Dt4-19: And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars —all the heavenly array —do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven. 
#Dt4-20: But as for you, the LORD took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are. 
#Dt4-21: The LORD was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance. 
#Dt4-22: I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land. 
#Dt4-23: Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the LORD your God has forbidden. 
#Dt4-24: For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. 
#Dt4-25: After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time —if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God and arousing his anger, 
#Dt4-26: I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed. 
#Dt4-27: The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you. 
#Dt4-28: There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell. 
#Dt4-29: But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
#Dt4-30: When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and obey him. 
#Dt4-31: For the LORD your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them by oath. 
#Dt4-32: Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created human beings on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of? 
#Dt4-33: Has any other people heard the voice of God "speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived? 
#Dt4-34: Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes? 
#Dt4-35: You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides him there is no other. 
#Dt4-36: From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire. 
#Dt4-37: Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength, 
#Dt4-38: to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today. 
#Dt4-39: Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other. 
#Dt4-40: Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the LORD your God gives you for all time. 
#Dt4-41: Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan, 
#Dt4-42: to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbor without malice aforethought. They could flee into one of these cities and save their life. 
#Dt4-43: The cities were these: Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites. 
#Dt4-44: This is the law Moses set before the Israelites. 
#Dt4-45: These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt 
#Dt4-46: and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt. 
#Dt4-47: They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. 
#Dt4-48: This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion "(that is, Hermon), 
#Dt4-49: and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Dead Sea, "below the slopes of Pisgah.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 5
#Dt5-1: Moses summoned all Israel and said: Hear, Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them. 
#Dt5-2: The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. 
#Dt5-3: It was not with our ancestors "that the LORD made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today. 
#Dt5-4: The LORD spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain. 
#Dt5-5: (At that time I stood between the LORD and you to declare to you the word of the LORD, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said: 
#Dt5-6: "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
#Dt5-7: "You shall have no other gods before "me. 
#Dt5-8: "You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 
#Dt5-9: You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 
#Dt5-10: but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments. 
#Dt5-11: "You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. 
#Dt5-12: "Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you. 
#Dt5-13: Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 
#Dt5-14: but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do. 
#Dt5-15: Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day. 
#Dt5-16: "Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the LORD your God is giving you. 
#Dt5-17: "You shall not murder. 
#Dt5-18: "You shall not commit adultery. 
#Dt5-19: "You shall not steal. 
#Dt5-20: "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. 
#Dt5-21: "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor." 
#Dt5-22: These are the commandments the LORD proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me. 
#Dt5-23: When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me. 
#Dt5-24: And you said, "The LORD our God has shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them. 
#Dt5-25: But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer. 
#Dt5-26: For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived? 
#Dt5-27: Go near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then tell us whatever the LORD our God tells you. We will listen and obey." 
#Dt5-28: The LORD heard you when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, "I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good. 
#Dt5-29: Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever! 
#Dt5-30: "Go, tell them to return to their tents. 
#Dt5-31: But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess." 
#Dt5-32: So be careful to do what the LORD your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left. 
#Dt5-33: Walk in obedience to all that the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 6
#Dt6-1: These are the commands, decrees and laws the LORD your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, 
#Dt6-2: so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the LORD your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life. 
#Dt6-3: Hear, Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you. 
#Dt6-4: Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. [^1] 
#Dt6-5: Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. 
#Dt6-6: These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. 
#Dt6-7: Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
#Dt6-8: Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
#Dt6-9: Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates. 
#Dt6-10: When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you —a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, 
#Dt6-11: houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant —then when you eat and are satisfied, 
#Dt6-12: be careful that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
#Dt6-13: Fear the LORD your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name. 
#Dt6-14: Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; 
#Dt6-15: for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land. 
#Dt6-16: Do not put the LORD your God to the test as you did at Massah. 
#Dt6-17: Be sure to keep the commands of the LORD your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you. 
#Dt6-18: Do what is right and good in the LORD's sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land the LORD promised on oath to your ancestors, 
#Dt6-19: thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the LORD said. 
#Dt6-20: In the future, when your son asks you, "What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the LORD our God has commanded you?" 
#Dt6-21: tell him: "We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
#Dt6-22: Before our eyes the LORD sent signs and wonders —great and terrible —on Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household. 
#Dt6-23: But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land he promised on oath to our ancestors. 
#Dt6-24: The LORD commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the LORD our God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today. 
#Dt6-25: And if we are careful to obey all this law before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness."
 DEUTERONÔMIO 7
#Dt7-1: When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations —the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you — 
#Dt7-2: and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. "Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy. 
#Dt7-3: Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, 
#Dt7-4: for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the LORD's anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you. 
#Dt7-5: This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles "and burn their idols in the fire. 
#Dt7-6: For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession. 
#Dt7-7: The LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. 
#Dt7-8: But it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
#Dt7-9: Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments. 
#Dt7-10: But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction; he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him. 
#Dt7-11: Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today. 
#Dt7-12: If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the LORD your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors. 
#Dt7-13: He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land —your grain, new wine and olive oil —the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you. 
#Dt7-14: You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young. 
#Dt7-15: The LORD will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you. 
#Dt7-16: You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you. 
#Dt7-17: You may say to yourselves, "These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?" 
#Dt7-18: But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt. 
#Dt7-19: You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear. 
#Dt7-20: Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished. 
#Dt7-21: Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God. 
#Dt7-22: The LORD your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you. 
#Dt7-23: But the LORD your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed. 
#Dt7-24: He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them. 
#Dt7-25: The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the LORD your God. 
#Dt7-26: Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 8
#Dt8-1: Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land the LORD promised on oath to your ancestors. 
#Dt8-2: Remember how the LORD your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands. 
#Dt8-3: He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. 
#Dt8-4: Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years. 
#Dt8-5: Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you. 
#Dt8-6: Observe the commands of the LORD your God, walking in obedience to him and revering him. 
#Dt8-7: For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land —a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills; 
#Dt8-8: a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey; 
#Dt8-9: a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills. 
#Dt8-10: When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the LORD your God for the good land he has given you. 
#Dt8-11: Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day. 
#Dt8-12: Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, 
#Dt8-13: and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied, 
#Dt8-14: then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
#Dt8-15: He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock. 
#Dt8-16: He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you. 
#Dt8-17: You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me." 
#Dt8-18: But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today. 
#Dt8-19: If you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed. 
#Dt8-20: Like the nations the LORD destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the LORD your God.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 9
#Dt9-1: Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky. 
#Dt9-2: The people are strong and tall —Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: "Who can stand up against the Anakites?" 
#Dt9-3: But be assured today that the LORD your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the LORD has promised you. 
#Dt9-4: After the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, "The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness." No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is going to drive them out before you. 
#Dt9-5: It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
#Dt9-6: Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people. 
#Dt9-7: Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the LORD your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the LORD. 
#Dt9-8: At Horeb you aroused the LORD's wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you. 
#Dt9-9: When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water. 
#Dt9-10: The LORD gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the LORD proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. 
#Dt9-11: At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. 
#Dt9-12: Then the LORD told me, "Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves." 
#Dt9-13: And the LORD said to me, "I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed! 
#Dt9-14: Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they." 
#Dt9-15: So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. 
#Dt9-16: When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you. 
#Dt9-17: So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes. 
#Dt9-18: Then once again I fell prostrate before the LORD for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the LORD's sight and so arousing his anger. 
#Dt9-19: I feared the anger and wrath of the LORD, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the LORD listened to me. 
#Dt9-20: And the LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too. 
#Dt9-21: Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain. 
#Dt9-22: You also made the LORD angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah. 
#Dt9-23: And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, "Go up and take possession of the land I have given you." But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not trust him or obey him. 
#Dt9-24: You have been rebellious against the LORD ever since I have known you. 
#Dt9-25: I lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said he would destroy you. 
#Dt9-26: I prayed to the LORD and said, "Sovereign LORD, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
#Dt9-27: Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin. 
#Dt9-28: Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, 'Because the LORD was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.' 
#Dt9-29: But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm."

#Dt10-1: At that time the LORD said to me, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark. [^1] 
#Dt10-2: I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark." 
#Dt10-3: So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 
#Dt10-4: The LORD wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me. 
#Dt10-5: Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD commanded me, and they are there now. 
#Dt10-6: (The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. 
#Dt10-7: From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water. 
#Dt10-8: At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today. 
#Dt10-9: That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the LORD is their inheritance, as the LORD your God told them.) 
#Dt10-10: Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the LORD listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you. 
#Dt10-11: "Go," the LORD said to me, "and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them." 
#Dt10-12: And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 
#Dt10-13: and to observe the LORD's commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good? 
#Dt10-14: To the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it. 
#Dt10-15: Yet the LORD set his affection on your ancestors and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations —as it is today. 
#Dt10-16: Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer. 
#Dt10-17: For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes. 
#Dt10-18: He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. 
#Dt10-19: And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt. 
#Dt10-20: Fear the LORD your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name. 
#Dt10-21: He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes. 
#Dt10-22: Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 11
#Dt11-1: Love the LORD your God and keep his requirements, his decrees, his laws and his commands always. 
#Dt11-2: Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the LORD your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm; 
#Dt11-3: the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country; 
#Dt11-4: what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea "as they were pursuing you, and how the LORD brought lasting ruin on them. 
#Dt11-5: It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place, 
#Dt11-6: and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to them. 
#Dt11-7: But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the LORD has done. 
#Dt11-8: Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, 
#Dt11-9: and so that you may live long in the land the LORD swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
#Dt11-10: The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden. 
#Dt11-11: But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven. 
#Dt11-12: It is a land the LORD your God cares for; the eyes of the LORD your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end. 
#Dt11-13: So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today —to love the LORD your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul — 
#Dt11-14: then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil. 
#Dt11-15: I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. 
#Dt11-16: Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them. 
#Dt11-17: Then the LORD's anger will burn against you, and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the LORD is giving you. 
#Dt11-18: Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
#Dt11-19: Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
#Dt11-20: Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates, 
#Dt11-21: so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the LORD swore to give your ancestors, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth. 
#Dt11-22: If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow —to love the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him — 
#Dt11-23: then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you. 
#Dt11-24: Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. 
#Dt11-25: No one will be able to stand against you. The LORD your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go. 
#Dt11-26: See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse — 
#Dt11-27: the blessing if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today; 
#Dt11-28: the curse if you disobey the commands of the LORD your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known. 
#Dt11-29: When the LORD your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount Ebal the curses. 
#Dt11-30: As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, westward, toward the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal. 
#Dt11-31: You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living there, 
#Dt11-32: be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 12
#Dt12-1: These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess —as long as you live in the land. 
#Dt12-2: Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods. 
#Dt12-3: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places. 
#Dt12-4: You must not worship the LORD your God in their way. 
#Dt12-5: But you are to seek the place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go; 
#Dt12-6: there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks. 
#Dt12-7: There, in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the LORD your God has blessed you. 
#Dt12-8: You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit, 
#Dt12-9: since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the LORD your God is giving you. 
#Dt12-10: But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety. 
#Dt12-11: Then to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name —there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the LORD. 
#Dt12-12: And there rejoice before the LORD your God —you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own. 
#Dt12-13: Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please. 
#Dt12-14: Offer them only at the place the LORD will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you. 
#Dt12-15: Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the LORD your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it. 
#Dt12-16: But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. 
#Dt12-17: You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts. 
#Dt12-18: Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will choose —you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns —and you are to rejoice before the LORD your God in everything you put your hand to. 
#Dt12-19: Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land. 
#Dt12-20: When the LORD your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you, and you crave meat and say, "I would like some meat," then you may eat as much of it as you want. 
#Dt12-21: If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want. 
#Dt12-22: Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat. 
#Dt12-23: But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat. 
#Dt12-24: You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. 
#Dt12-25: Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD. 
#Dt12-26: But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the LORD will choose. 
#Dt12-27: Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God, both the meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat. 
#Dt12-28: Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God. 
#Dt12-29: The LORD your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land, 
#Dt12-30: and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, "How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same." 
#Dt12-31: You must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods. 
#Dt12-32: See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it. [^1]

#Dt13-1: If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a sign or wonder, 
#Dt13-2: and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, "Let us follow other gods" (gods you have not known) "and let us worship them," 
#Dt13-3: you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
#Dt13-4: It is the LORD your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. 
#Dt13-5: That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. That prophet or dreamer tried to turn you from the way the LORD your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you. 
#Dt13-6: If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods" (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, 
#Dt13-7: gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other), 
#Dt13-8: do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. 
#Dt13-9: You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. 
#Dt13-10: Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
#Dt13-11: Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an evil thing again. 
#Dt13-12: If you hear it said about one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you to live in 
#Dt13-13: that troublemakers have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods" (gods you have not known), 
#Dt13-14: then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you, 
#Dt13-15: you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. You must destroy it completely, "both its people and its livestock. 
#Dt13-16: You are to gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town is to remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt, 
#Dt13-17: and none of the condemned things "are to be found in your hands. Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger, will show you mercy, and will have compassion on you. He will increase your numbers, as he promised on oath to your ancestors — 
#Dt13-18: because you obey the LORD your God by keeping all his commands that I am giving you today and doing what is right in his eyes.

#Dt14-3: Do not eat any detestable thing.

#Dt14-5: the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep. [^1] 
#Dt14-6: You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud. 
#Dt14-7: However, of those that chew the cud or that have a divided hoof you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you. 
#Dt14-8: The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses. 
#Dt14-9: Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins and scales. 
#Dt14-10: But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean. 
#Dt14-11: You may eat any clean bird. 
#Dt14-12: But these you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, 
#Dt14-13: the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon, 
#Dt14-14: any kind of raven, 
#Dt14-15: the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, 
#Dt14-16: the little owl, the great owl, the white owl, 
#Dt14-17: the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant, 
#Dt14-18: the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. 
#Dt14-19: All flying insects are unclean to you; do not eat them. 
#Dt14-20: But any winged creature that is clean you may eat. 
#Dt14-21: Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to the foreigner residing in any of your towns, and they may eat it, or you may sell it to any other foreigner. But you are a people holy to the LORD your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk. 
#Dt14-22: Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year. 
#Dt14-23: Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name, so that you may learn to revere the LORD your God always. 
#Dt14-24: But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the LORD your God and cannot carry your tithe (because the place where the LORD will choose to put his Name is so far away), 
#Dt14-25: then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the LORD your God will choose. 
#Dt14-26: Use the silver to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice. 
#Dt14-27: And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own. 
#Dt14-28: At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year's produce and store it in your towns, 
#Dt14-29: so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.

#Dt15-1: At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. 
#Dt15-2: This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the LORD's time for canceling debts has been proclaimed. 
#Dt15-3: You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. 
#Dt15-4: However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you, 
#Dt15-5: if only you fully obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today. 
#Dt15-6: For the LORD your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you. 
#Dt15-7: If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them. 
#Dt15-8: Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need. 
#Dt15-9: Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: "The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near," so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the LORD against you, and you will be found guilty of sin. 
#Dt15-10: Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to. 
#Dt15-11: There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land. 
#Dt15-12: If any of your people —Hebrew men or women —sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. 
#Dt15-13: And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. 
#Dt15-14: Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the LORD your God has blessed you. 
#Dt15-15: Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today. 
#Dt15-16: But if your servant says to you, "I do not want to leave you," because he loves you and your family and is well off with you, 
#Dt15-17: then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant. 
#Dt15-18: Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do. 
#Dt15-19: Set apart for the LORD your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep. 
#Dt15-20: Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose. 
#Dt15-21: If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.

#Dt16-3: Do not eat it with bread made with yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste —so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt. 
#Dt16-4: Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days. Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning. 
#Dt16-5: You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the LORD your God gives you 
#Dt16-6: except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name. There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary "of your departure from Egypt.

#Dt16-8: For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the LORD your God and do no work.

#Dt16-12: Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees. 
#Dt16-13: Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress.

#Dt16-15: For seven days celebrate the festival to the LORD your God at the place the LORD will choose. For the LORD your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete. 
#Dt16-16: Three times a year all your men must appear before the LORD your God at the place he will choose: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles. No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed: 
#Dt16-17: Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the LORD your God has blessed you. 
#Dt16-18: Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the LORD your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly. 
#Dt16-19: Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent. 
#Dt16-20: Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the land the LORD your God is giving you.

#Dt17-4: and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, 
#Dt17-5: take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death. 
#Dt17-6: On the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death, but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 
#Dt17-7: The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death, and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you. 
#Dt17-8: If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge —whether bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults —take them to the place the LORD your God will choose. 
#Dt17-9: Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict. 
#Dt17-10: You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the LORD will choose. Be careful to do everything they instruct you to do. 
#Dt17-11: Act according to whatever they teach you and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right or to the left. 
#Dt17-12: Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the LORD your God is to be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel. 
#Dt17-13: All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not be contemptuous again. 
#Dt17-14: When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, "Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us," 
#Dt17-15: be sure to appoint over you a king the LORD your God chooses. He must be from among your fellow Israelites. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not an Israelite. 
#Dt17-16: The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the LORD has told you, "You are not to go back that way again." 
#Dt17-17: He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold. 
#Dt17-18: When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests. 
#Dt17-19: It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees 
#Dt17-20: and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 18
#Dt18-1: The Levitical priests —indeed, the whole tribe of Levi —are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the food offerings presented to the LORD, for that is their inheritance. 
#Dt18-2: They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them. 
#Dt18-3: This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head. 
#Dt18-4: You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep, 
#Dt18-5: for the LORD your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the LORD's name always. 
#Dt18-6: If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the LORD will choose, 
#Dt18-7: he may minister in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the LORD. 
#Dt18-8: He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions. 
#Dt18-9: When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. 
#Dt18-10: Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, 
#Dt18-11: or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. 
#Dt18-12: Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD; because of these same detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. 
#Dt18-13: You must be blameless before the LORD your God. 
#Dt18-14: The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so. 
#Dt18-15: The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him. 
#Dt18-16: For this is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, "Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die." 
#Dt18-17: The LORD said to me: "What they say is good. 
#Dt18-18: I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him. 
#Dt18-19: I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name. 
#Dt18-20: But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death." 
#Dt18-21: You may say to yourselves, "How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?" 
#Dt18-22: If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 19
#Dt19-1: When the LORD your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses, 
#Dt19-2: then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess. 
#Dt19-3: Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that a person who kills someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities. 
#Dt19-4: This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety —anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought. 
#Dt19-5: For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life. 
#Dt19-6: Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought. 
#Dt19-7: This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities. 
#Dt19-8: If the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your ancestors, and gives you the whole land he promised them, 
#Dt19-9: because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today —to love the LORD your God and to walk always in obedience to him —then you are to set aside three more cities. 
#Dt19-10: Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed. 
#Dt19-11: But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor, and then flees to one of these cities, 
#Dt19-12: the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die. 
#Dt19-13: Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you. 
#Dt19-14: Do not move your neighbor's boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess. 
#Dt19-15: One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
#Dt19-16: If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime, 
#Dt19-17: the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time. 
#Dt19-18: The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite, 
#Dt19-19: then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you. 
#Dt19-20: The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you. 
#Dt19-21: Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 20
#Dt20-1: When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you. 
#Dt20-2: When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army. 
#Dt20-3: He shall say: "Hear, Israel: Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified by them. 
#Dt20-4: For the LORD your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory." 
#Dt20-5: The officers shall say to the army: "Has anyone built a new house and not yet begun to live in it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else may begin to live in it. 
#Dt20-6: Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it. 
#Dt20-7: Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else marry her." 
#Dt20-8: Then the officers shall add, "Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too." 
#Dt20-9: When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint commanders over it. 
#Dt20-10: When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. 
#Dt20-11: If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. 
#Dt20-12: If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. 
#Dt20-13: When the LORD your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. 
#Dt20-14: As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the LORD your God gives you from your enemies. 
#Dt20-15: This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby. 
#Dt20-16: However, in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. 
#Dt20-17: Completely destroy "them —the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites —as the LORD your God has commanded you. 
#Dt20-18: Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the LORD your God. 
#Dt20-19: When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees people, that you should besiege them? [^2] 
#Dt20-20: However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 21
#Dt21-1: If someone is found slain, lying in a field in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who the killer was, 
#Dt21-2: your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns. 
#Dt21-3: Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke 
#Dt21-4: and lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifer's neck. 
#Dt21-5: The Levitical priests shall step forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the LORD and to decide all cases of dispute and assault. 
#Dt21-6: Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley, 
#Dt21-7: and they shall declare: "Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done. 
#Dt21-8: Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, LORD, and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent person." Then the bloodshed will be atoned for, 
#Dt21-9: and you will have purged from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the LORD. 
#Dt21-10: When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives, 
#Dt21-11: if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife. 
#Dt21-12: Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails 
#Dt21-13: and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife. 
#Dt21-14: If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her. 
#Dt21-15: If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love, 
#Dt21-16: when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the wife he does not love. 
#Dt21-17: He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father's strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him. 
#Dt21-18: If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, 
#Dt21-19: his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. 
#Dt21-20: They shall say to the elders, "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard." 
#Dt21-21: Then all the men of his town are to stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid. 
#Dt21-22: If someone guilty of a capital offense is put to death and their body is exposed on a pole, 
#Dt21-23: you must not leave the body hanging on the pole overnight. Be sure to bury it that same day, because anyone who is hung on a pole is under God's curse. You must not desecrate the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.

#Dt22-3: Do the same if you find their donkey or cloak or anything else they have lost. Do not ignore it. 
#Dt22-4: If you see your fellow Israelite's donkey or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it. Help the owner get it to its feet. 
#Dt22-5: A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this. 
#Dt22-6: If you come across a bird's nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young. 
#Dt22-7: You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life. 
#Dt22-8: When you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof. 
#Dt22-9: Do not plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard; if you do, not only the crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be defiled. [^1]

#Dt22-14: and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, "I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity," 
#Dt22-15: then the young woman's father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin. 
#Dt22-16: Her father will say to the elders, "I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. 
#Dt22-17: Now he has slandered her and said, 'I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.' But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity." Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town, 
#Dt22-18: and the elders shall take the man and punish him. 
#Dt22-19: They shall fine him a hundred shekels "of silver and give them to the young woman's father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives. 
#Dt22-20: If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman's virginity can be found, 
#Dt22-21: she shall be brought to the door of her father's house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father's house. You must purge the evil from among you. 
#Dt22-22: If a man is found sleeping with another man's wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel. 
#Dt22-23: If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her, 
#Dt22-24: you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death —the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man's wife. You must purge the evil from among you. 
#Dt22-25: But if out in the country a man happens to meet a young woman pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die. 
#Dt22-26: Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor, 
#Dt22-27: for the man found the young woman out in the country, and though the betrothed woman screamed, there was no one to rescue her. 
#Dt22-28: If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, 
#Dt22-29: he shall pay her father fifty shekels "of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives. 
#Dt22-30: A man is not to marry his father's wife; he must not dishonor his father's bed. [^4]

#Dt23-3: No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, not even in the tenth generation. 
#Dt23-4: For they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim "to pronounce a curse on you. 
#Dt23-5: However, the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam but turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you. 
#Dt23-6: Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them as long as you live. 
#Dt23-7: Do not despise an Edomite, for the Edomites are related to you. Do not despise an Egyptian, because you resided as foreigners in their country.

#Dt23-9: When you are encamped against your enemies, keep away from everything impure. 
#Dt23-10: If one of your men is unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he is to go outside the camp and stay there. 
#Dt23-11: But as evening approaches he is to wash himself, and at sunset he may return to the camp. 
#Dt23-12: Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself. 
#Dt23-13: As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement. 
#Dt23-14: For the LORD your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you. 
#Dt23-15: If a slave has taken refuge with you, do not hand them over to their master.

#Dt23-19: Do not charge a fellow Israelite interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest. 
#Dt23-20: You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite, so that the LORD your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess. 
#Dt23-21: If you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not be slow to pay it, for the LORD your God will certainly demand it of you and you will be guilty of sin. 
#Dt23-22: But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty. 
#Dt23-23: Whatever your lips utter you must be sure to do, because you made your vow freely to the LORD your God with your own mouth. 
#Dt23-24: If you enter your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but do not put any in your basket.

#Dt24-3: and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house, or if he dies, 
#Dt24-4: then her first husband, who divorced her, is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled. That would be detestable in the eyes of the LORD. Do not bring sin upon the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. 
#Dt24-5: If a man has recently married, he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him. For one year he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married.

#Dt24-12: If the neighbor is poor, do not go to sleep with their pledge in your possession. 
#Dt24-13: Return their cloak by sunset so that your neighbor may sleep in it. Then they will thank you, and it will be regarded as a righteous act in the sight of the LORD your God. 
#Dt24-14: Do not take advantage of a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether that worker is a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in one of your towns. 
#Dt24-15: Pay them their wages each day before sunset, because they are poor and are counting on it. Otherwise they may cry to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty of sin. 
#Dt24-16: Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin. 
#Dt24-17: Do not deprive the foreigner or the fatherless of justice, or take the cloak of the widow as a pledge.

#Dt25-2: If the guilty person deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make them lie down and have them flogged in his presence with the number of lashes the crime deserves, 
#Dt25-3: but the judge must not impose more than forty lashes. If the guilty party is flogged more than that, your fellow Israelite will be degraded in your eyes. 
#Dt25-4: Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. 
#Dt25-5: If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband's brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her. 
#Dt25-6: The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel. 
#Dt25-7: However, if a man does not want to marry his brother's wife, she shall go to the elders at the town gate and say, "My husband's brother refuses to carry on his brother's name in Israel. He will not fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me."

#Dt25-15: You must have accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you. 
#Dt25-16: For the LORD your God detests anyone who does these things, anyone who deals dishonestly. 
#Dt25-17: Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt. 
#Dt25-18: When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and attacked all who were lagging behind; they had no fear of God. 
#Dt25-19: When the LORD your God gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land he is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you shall blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!
 DEUTERONÔMIO 26
#Dt26-1: When you have entered the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance and have taken possession of it and settled in it, 
#Dt26-2: take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the LORD your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name 
#Dt26-3: and say to the priest in office at the time, "I declare today to the LORD your God that I have come to the land the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us." 
#Dt26-4: The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the LORD your God. 
#Dt26-5: Then you shall declare before the LORD your God: "My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous. 
#Dt26-6: But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer, subjecting us to harsh labor. 
#Dt26-7: Then we cried out to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, and the LORD heard our voice and saw our misery, toil and oppression. 
#Dt26-8: So the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders. 
#Dt26-9: He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
#Dt26-10: and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil that you, LORD, have given me." Place the basket before the LORD your God and bow down before him. 
#Dt26-11: Then you and the Levites and the foreigners residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the LORD your God has given to you and your household. 
#Dt26-12: When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied. 
#Dt26-13: Then say to the LORD your God: "I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, according to all you commanded. I have not turned aside from your commands nor have I forgotten any of them. 
#Dt26-14: I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the LORD my God; I have done everything you commanded me. 
#Dt26-15: Look down from heaven, your holy dwelling place, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey." 
#Dt26-16: The LORD your God commands you this day to follow these decrees and laws; carefully observe them with all your heart and with all your soul. 
#Dt26-17: You have declared this day that the LORD is your God and that you will walk in obedience to him, that you will keep his decrees, commands and laws —that you will listen to him. 
#Dt26-18: And the LORD has declared this day that you are his people, his treasured possession as he promised, and that you are to keep all his commands. 
#Dt26-19: He has declared that he will set you in praise, fame and honor high above all the nations he has made and that you will be a people holy to the LORD your God, as he promised.

#Dt27-1: Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: "Keep all these commands that I give you today. 
#Dt27-2: When you have crossed the Jordan into the land the LORD your God is giving you, set up some large stones and coat them with plaster. 
#Dt27-3: Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you. 
#Dt27-4: And when you have crossed the Jordan, set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I command you today, and coat them with plaster. 
#Dt27-5: Build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. Do not use any iron tool on them. 
#Dt27-6: Build the altar of the LORD your God with fieldstones and offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God. 
#Dt27-7: Sacrifice fellowship offerings there, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God. 
#Dt27-8: And you shall write very clearly all the words of this law on these stones you have set up." 
#Dt27-9: Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, "Be silent, Israel, and listen! You have now become the people of the LORD your God. 
#Dt27-10: Obey the LORD your God and follow his commands and decrees that I give you today." 
#Dt27-11: On the same day Moses commanded the people: 
#Dt27-12: When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin. 
#Dt27-13: And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali. 
#Dt27-14: The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice: 
#Dt27-15: "Cursed is anyone who makes an idol —a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of skilled hands —and sets it up in secret." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-16: "Cursed is anyone who dishonors their father or mother." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-17: "Cursed is anyone who moves their neighbor's boundary stone." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-18: "Cursed is anyone who leads the blind astray on the road." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-19: "Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-20: "Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his father's wife, for he dishonors his father's bed." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-21: "Cursed is anyone who has sexual relations with any animal." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-22: "Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-23: "Cursed is anyone who sleeps with his mother-in-law." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-24: "Cursed is anyone who kills their neighbor secretly." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-25: "Cursed is anyone who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" 
#Dt27-26: "Cursed is anyone who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
 DEUTERONÔMIO 28
#Dt28-1: If you fully obey the LORD your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations on earth. 
#Dt28-2: All these blessings will come on you and accompany you if you obey the LORD your God: 
#Dt28-3: You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country. 
#Dt28-4: The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock —the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. 
#Dt28-5: Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed. 
#Dt28-6: You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out. 
#Dt28-7: The LORD will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven. 
#Dt28-8: The LORD will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is giving you. 
#Dt28-9: The LORD will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you on oath, if you keep the commands of the LORD your God and walk in obedience to him. 
#Dt28-10: Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will fear you. 
#Dt28-11: The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity —in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground —in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you. 
#Dt28-12: The LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. 
#Dt28-13: The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom. 
#Dt28-14: Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them. 
#Dt28-15: However, if you do not obey the LORD your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come on you and overtake you: 
#Dt28-16: You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country. 
#Dt28-17: Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed. 
#Dt28-18: The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. 
#Dt28-19: You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out. 
#Dt28-20: The LORD will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him. [^1] 
#Dt28-21: The LORD will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess. 
#Dt28-22: The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish. 
#Dt28-23: The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron. 
#Dt28-24: The LORD will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed. 
#Dt28-25: The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth. 
#Dt28-26: Your carcasses will be food for all the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away. 
#Dt28-27: The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured. 
#Dt28-28: The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind. 
#Dt28-29: At midday you will grope about like a blind person in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you. 
#Dt28-30: You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and rape her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. 
#Dt28-31: Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them. 
#Dt28-32: Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand. 
#Dt28-33: A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days. 
#Dt28-34: The sights you see will drive you mad. 
#Dt28-35: The LORD will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head. 
#Dt28-36: The LORD will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your ancestors. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone. 
#Dt28-37: You will become a thing of horror, a byword and an object of ridicule among all the peoples where the LORD will drive you. 
#Dt28-38: You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it. 
#Dt28-39: You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them. 
#Dt28-40: You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off. 
#Dt28-41: You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity. 
#Dt28-42: Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land. 
#Dt28-43: The foreigners who reside among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower. 
#Dt28-44: They will lend to you, but you will not lend to them. They will be the head, but you will be the tail. 
#Dt28-45: All these curses will come on you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you. 
#Dt28-46: They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever. 
#Dt28-47: Because you did not serve the LORD your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity, 
#Dt28-48: therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the LORD sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. 
#Dt28-49: The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand, 
#Dt28-50: a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young. 
#Dt28-51: They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or olive oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined. 
#Dt28-52: They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you. 
#Dt28-53: Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you. 
#Dt28-54: Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children, 
#Dt28-55: and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. 
#Dt28-56: The most gentle and sensitive woman among you —so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot —will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter 
#Dt28-57: the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For in her dire need she intends to eat them secretly because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of your cities. 
#Dt28-58: If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name —the LORD your God — 
#Dt28-59: the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. 
#Dt28-60: He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. 
#Dt28-61: The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. 
#Dt28-62: You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God. 
#Dt28-63: Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. 
#Dt28-64: Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods —gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known. 
#Dt28-65: Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. 
#Dt28-66: You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. 
#Dt28-67: In the morning you will say, "If only it were evening!" and in the evening, "If only it were morning!" —because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. 
#Dt28-68: The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 29
#Dt29-1: These are the terms of the covenant the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb. 
#Dt29-2: Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them: Your eyes have seen all that the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all his land. 
#Dt29-3: With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those signs and great wonders. 
#Dt29-4: But to this day the LORD has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear. 
#Dt29-5: Yet the LORD says, "During the forty years that I led you through the wilderness, your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet. 
#Dt29-6: You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the LORD your God." 
#Dt29-7: When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them. 
#Dt29-8: We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
#Dt29-9: Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do. 
#Dt29-10: All of you are standing today in the presence of the LORD your God —your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel, 
#Dt29-11: together with your children and your wives, and the foreigners living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water. 
#Dt29-12: You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the LORD your God, a covenant the LORD is making with you this day and sealing with an oath, 
#Dt29-13: to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
#Dt29-14: I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you 
#Dt29-15: who are standing here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God but also with those who are not here today. 
#Dt29-16: You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here. 
#Dt29-17: You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold. 
#Dt29-18: Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison. 
#Dt29-19: When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves, thinking, "I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way," they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. 
#Dt29-20: The LORD will never be willing to forgive them; his wrath and zeal will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will fall on them, and the LORD will blot out their names from under heaven. 
#Dt29-21: The LORD will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law. 
#Dt29-22: Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it. 
#Dt29-23: The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur —nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, which the LORD overthrew in fierce anger. 
#Dt29-24: All the nations will ask: "Why has the LORD done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?" 
#Dt29-25: And the answer will be: "It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt. 
#Dt29-26: They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them. 
#Dt29-27: Therefore the LORD's anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book. 
#Dt29-28: In furious anger and in great wrath the LORD uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now." 
#Dt29-29: The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 30
#Dt30-1: When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come on you and you take them to heart wherever the LORD your God disperses you among the nations, 
#Dt30-2: and when you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today, 
#Dt30-3: then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes "and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you. 
#Dt30-4: Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the LORD your God will gather you and bring you back. 
#Dt30-5: He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors. 
#Dt30-6: The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live. 
#Dt30-7: The LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you. 
#Dt30-8: You will again obey the LORD and follow all his commands I am giving you today. 
#Dt30-9: Then the LORD your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your land. The LORD will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as he delighted in your ancestors, 
#Dt30-10: if you obey the LORD your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 
#Dt30-11: Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. 
#Dt30-12: It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, "Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?" 
#Dt30-13: Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, "Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?" 
#Dt30-14: No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it. 
#Dt30-15: See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction. 
#Dt30-16: For I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess. 
#Dt30-17: But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, 
#Dt30-18: I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. 
#Dt30-19: This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live 
#Dt30-20: and that you may love the LORD your God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to him. For the LORD is your life, and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
 DEUTERONÔMIO 31
#Dt31-1: Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel: 
#Dt31-2: "I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The LORD has said to me, 'You shall not cross the Jordan.' 
#Dt31-3: The LORD your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the LORD said. 
#Dt31-4: And the LORD will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom he destroyed along with their land. 
#Dt31-5: The LORD will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you. 
#Dt31-6: Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you." 
#Dt31-7: Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the LORD swore to their ancestors to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance. 
#Dt31-8: The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged." 
#Dt31-9: So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel. 
#Dt31-10: Then Moses commanded them: "At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Festival of Tabernacles, 
#Dt31-11: when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing. 
#Dt31-12: Assemble the people —men, women and children, and the foreigners residing in your towns —so they can listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and follow carefully all the words of this law. 
#Dt31-13: Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess." 
#Dt31-14: The LORD said to Moses, "Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, where I will commission him." So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the tent of meeting. 
#Dt31-15: Then the LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent. 
#Dt31-16: And the LORD said to Moses: "You are going to rest with your ancestors, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them. 
#Dt31-17: And in that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and calamities will come on them, and in that day they will ask, 'Have not these disasters come on us because our God is not with us?' 
#Dt31-18: And I will certainly hide my face in that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods. 
#Dt31-19: "Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them. 
#Dt31-20: When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant. 
#Dt31-21: And when many disasters and calamities come on them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath." 
#Dt31-22: So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites. 
#Dt31-23: The LORD gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you." 
#Dt31-24: After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end, 
#Dt31-25: he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD: 
#Dt31-26: "Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God. There it will remain as a witness against you. 
#Dt31-27: For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the LORD while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die! 
#Dt31-28: Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to testify against them. 
#Dt31-29: For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD and arouse his anger by what your hands have made." 
#Dt31-30: And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:
 DEUTERONÔMIO 32
#Dt32-1: Listen, you heavens, and I will speak; hear, you earth, the words of my mouth. 
#Dt32-2: Let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew, like showers on new grass, like abundant rain on tender plants. 
#Dt32-3: I will proclaim the name of the LORD. Oh, praise the greatness of our God! 
#Dt32-4: He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he. 
#Dt32-5: They are corrupt and not his children; to their shame they are a warped and crooked generation. 
#Dt32-6: Is this the way you repay the LORD, you foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, "who made you and formed you? 
#Dt32-7: Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you. 
#Dt32-8: When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel. [^2] 
#Dt32-9: For the LORD's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance. 
#Dt32-10: In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye, 
#Dt32-11: like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them aloft. 
#Dt32-12: The LORD alone led him; no foreign god was with him. 
#Dt32-13: He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag, 
#Dt32-14: with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape. 
#Dt32-15: Jeshurun "grew fat and kicked; filled with food, they became heavy and sleek. They abandoned the God who made them and rejected the Rock their Savior. 
#Dt32-16: They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols. 
#Dt32-17: They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God — gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your ancestors did not fear. 
#Dt32-18: You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth. 
#Dt32-19: The LORD saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters. 
#Dt32-20: "I will hide my face from them," he said, "and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful. 
#Dt32-21: They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding. 
#Dt32-22: For a fire will be kindled by my wrath, one that burns down to the realm of the dead below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains. 
#Dt32-23: "I will heap calamities on them and spend my arrows against them. 
#Dt32-24: I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust. 
#Dt32-25: In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. The young men and young women will perish, the infants and those with gray hair. 
#Dt32-26: I said I would scatter them and erase their name from human memory, 
#Dt32-27: but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, 'Our hand has triumphed; the LORD has not done all this.'" 
#Dt32-28: They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them. 
#Dt32-29: If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be! 
#Dt32-30: How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up? 
#Dt32-31: For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede. 
#Dt32-32: Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness. 
#Dt32-33: Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras. 
#Dt32-34: "Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults? 
#Dt32-35: It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them." 
#Dt32-36: The LORD will vindicate his people and relent concerning his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free. [^4] 
#Dt32-37: He will say: "Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in, 
#Dt32-38: the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up to help you! Let them give you shelter! 
#Dt32-39: "See now that I myself am he! There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand. 
#Dt32-40: I lift my hand to heaven and solemnly swear: As surely as I live forever, 
#Dt32-41: when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me. 
#Dt32-42: I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders." 
#Dt32-43: Rejoice, you nations, with his people, ""for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people. 
#Dt32-44: Moses came with Joshua "son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people. 
#Dt32-45: When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel, 
#Dt32-46: he said to them, "Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law. 
#Dt32-47: They are not just idle words for you —they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess." 
#Dt32-48: On that same day the LORD told Moses, 
#Dt32-49: "Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession. 
#Dt32-50: There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. 
#Dt32-51: This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites. 
#Dt32-52: Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel."
 DEUTERONÔMIO 33
#Dt33-1: This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death. 
#Dt33-2: He said: "The LORD came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with "myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes. [^2] 
#Dt33-3: Surely it is you who love the people; all the holy ones are in your hand. At your feet they all bow down, and from you receive instruction, 
#Dt33-4: the law that Moses gave us, the possession of the assembly of Jacob. 
#Dt33-5: He was king over Jeshurun "when the leaders of the people assembled, along with the tribes of Israel. 
#Dt33-6: "Let Reuben live and not die, nor "his people be few." 
#Dt33-7: And this he said about Judah: "Hear, LORD, the cry of Judah; bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause. Oh, be his help against his foes!" 
#Dt33-8: About Levi he said: "Your Thummim and Urim belong to your faithful servant. You tested him at Massah; you contended with him at the waters of Meribah. 
#Dt33-9: He said of his father and mother, 'I have no regard for them.' He did not recognize his brothers or acknowledge his own children, but he watched over your word and guarded your covenant. 
#Dt33-10: He teaches your precepts to Jacob and your law to Israel. He offers incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar. 
#Dt33-11: Bless all his skills, LORD, and be pleased with the work of his hands. Strike down those who rise against him, his foes till they rise no more." 
#Dt33-12: About Benjamin he said: "Let the beloved of the LORD rest secure in him, for he shields him all day long, and the one the LORD loves rests between his shoulders." 
#Dt33-13: About Joseph he said: "May the LORD bless his land with the precious dew from heaven above and with the deep waters that lie below; 
#Dt33-14: with the best the sun brings forth and the finest the moon can yield; 
#Dt33-15: with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills; 
#Dt33-16: with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among "his brothers. 
#Dt33-17: In majesty he is like a firstborn bull; his horns are the horns of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even those at the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim; such are the thousands of Manasseh." 
#Dt33-18: About Zebulun he said: "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents. 
#Dt33-19: They will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer the sacrifices of the righteous; they will feast on the abundance of the seas, on the treasures hidden in the sand." 
#Dt33-20: About Gad he said: "Blessed is he who enlarges Gad's domain! Gad lives there like a lion, tearing at arm or head. 
#Dt33-21: He chose the best land for himself; the leader's portion was kept for him. When the heads of the people assembled, he carried out the LORD's righteous will, and his judgments concerning Israel." 
#Dt33-22: About Dan he said: "Dan is a lion's cub, springing out of Bashan." 
#Dt33-23: About Naphtali he said: "Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the LORD and is full of his blessing; he will inherit southward to the lake." 
#Dt33-24: About Asher he said: "Most blessed of sons is Asher; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him bathe his feet in oil. 
#Dt33-25: The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze, and your strength will equal your days. 
#Dt33-26: "There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides across the heavens to help you and on the clouds in his majesty. 
#Dt33-27: The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He will drive out your enemies before you, saying, 'Destroy them!' 
#Dt33-28: So Israel will live in safety; Jacob will dwell "secure in a land of grain and new wine, where the heavens drop dew. 
#Dt33-29: Blessed are you, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. Your enemies will cower before you, and you will tread on their heights."
 DEUTERONÔMIO 34
#Dt34-1: Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him the whole land —from Gilead to Dan, 
#Dt34-2: all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea, 
#Dt34-3: the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar. 
#Dt34-4: Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it." 
#Dt34-5: And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab, as the LORD had said. 
#Dt34-6: He buried him "in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is. 
#Dt34-7: Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone. 
#Dt34-8: The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over. 
#Dt34-9: Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit "of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses. 
#Dt34-10: Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, 
#Dt34-11: who did all those signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt —to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land. 
#Dt34-12: For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.

#Js1-1: After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' aide: 
#Js1-2: "Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them —to the Israelites. 
#Js1-3: I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses. 
#Js1-4: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates —all the Hittite country —to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
#Js1-5: No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you. 
#Js1-6: Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them. 
#Js1-7: "Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go. 
#Js1-8: Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. 
#Js1-9: Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go." 
#Js1-10: So Joshua ordered the officers of the people: 
#Js1-11: "Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get your provisions ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you for your own.'" 
#Js1-12: But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, 
#Js1-13: "Remember the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you after he said, 'The LORD your God will give you rest by giving you this land.' 
#Js1-14: Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites. You are to help them 
#Js1-15: until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise." 
#Js1-16: Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
#Js1-17: Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses. 
#Js1-18: Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey it, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!"
 JOSUÉ 2
#Js2-1: Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. "Go, look over the land," he said, "especially Jericho." So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there. 
#Js2-2: The king of Jericho was told, "Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land." 
#Js2-3: So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land." 
#Js2-4: But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from. 
#Js2-5: At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I don't know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them." 
#Js2-6: (But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.) 
#Js2-7: So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut. 
#Js2-8: Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof 
#Js2-9: and said to them, "I know that the LORD has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you. 
#Js2-10: We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea "for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed. [^2] 
#Js2-11: When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. 
#Js2-12: "Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign 
#Js2-13: that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them —and that you will save us from death." 
#Js2-14: "Our lives for your lives!" the men assured her. "If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land." 
#Js2-15: So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall. 
#Js2-16: She said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way." 
#Js2-17: Now the men had said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us 
#Js2-18: unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house. 
#Js2-19: If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads; we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house with you, their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them. 
#Js2-20: But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear." 
#Js2-21: "Agreed," she replied. "Let it be as you say." So she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window. 
#Js2-22: When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them. 
#Js2-23: Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them. 
#Js2-24: They said to Joshua, "The LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us."
 JOSUÉ 3
#Js3-1: When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua, 
#Js3-2: "Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe, 
#Js3-3: and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight." 
#Js3-4: So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, 
#Js3-5: and said to them, "Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, 
#Js3-6: to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?' 
#Js3-7: tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever." 
#Js3-8: So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down. 
#Js3-9: Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day. 
#Js3-10: Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the LORD had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over, 
#Js3-11: and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the LORD and the priests came to the other side while the people watched. 
#Js3-12: The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, armed, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them. 
#Js3-13: About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for war. 
#Js3-14: That day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses. 
#Js3-15: Then the LORD said to Joshua, 
#Js3-16: "Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan." 
#Js3-17: So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan." 
#Js3-18: And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before. 
#Js3-19: On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. 
#Js3-20: And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan. 
#Js3-21: He said to the Israelites, "In the future when your descendants ask their fathers, 'What do these stones mean?' 
#Js3-22: tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.' 
#Js3-23: For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The LORD your God did to the Jordan just what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over. 
#Js3-24: He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God."

#Js4-4: So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, 
#Js4-5: and said to them, "Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, 
#Js4-6: to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?' 
#Js4-7: tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever." 
#Js4-8: So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down. 
#Js4-9: Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been "in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day. 
#Js4-10: Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the LORD had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over, 
#Js4-11: and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the LORD and the priests came to the other side while the people watched. 
#Js4-12: The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, ready for battle, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them. 
#Js4-13: About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for war. 
#Js4-14: That day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they stood in awe of him all the days of his life, just as they had stood in awe of Moses. 
#Js4-15: Then the LORD said to Joshua, 
#Js4-16: "Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant law to come up out of the Jordan." 
#Js4-17: So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan." 
#Js4-18: And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before. 
#Js4-19: On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. 
#Js4-20: And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan. 
#Js4-21: He said to the Israelites, "In the future when your descendants ask their parents, 'What do these stones mean?' 
#Js4-22: tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.' 
#Js4-23: For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The LORD your God did to the Jordan what he had done to the Red Sea "when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over. 
#Js4-24: He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God."
 JOSUÉ 5
#Js5-1: Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until they "had crossed over, their hearts melted in fear and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites. 
#Js5-2: At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again." 
#Js5-3: So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth. [^2] 
#Js5-4: Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt —all the men of military age —died in the wilderness on the way after leaving Egypt. 
#Js5-5: All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not. 
#Js5-6: The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the LORD. For the LORD had sworn to them that they would not see the land he had solemnly promised their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
#Js5-7: So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way. 
#Js5-8: And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed. 
#Js5-9: Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the place has been called Gilgal "to this day. 
#Js5-10: On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover. 
#Js5-11: The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain. 
#Js5-12: The manna stopped the day after "they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate the produce of Canaan. 
#Js5-13: Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, "Are you for us or for our enemies?" 
#Js5-14: "Neither," he replied, "but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, "What message does my Lord "have for his servant?" 
#Js5-15: The commander of the LORD's army replied, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.

#Js6-1: Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in. 
#Js6-2: Then the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. 
#Js6-3: March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. 
#Js6-4: Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. 
#Js6-5: When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in." 
#Js6-6: So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant of the LORD and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it." 
#Js6-7: And he ordered the army, "Advance! March around the city, with an armed guard going ahead of the ark of the LORD." 
#Js6-8: When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the LORD went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the LORD's covenant followed them. 
#Js6-9: The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding. 
#Js6-10: But Joshua had commanded the army, "Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!" 
#Js6-11: So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. Then the army returned to camp and spent the night there. 
#Js6-12: Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. 
#Js6-13: The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the LORD and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets kept sounding. 
#Js6-14: So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days. 
#Js6-15: On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times. 
#Js6-16: The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the army, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city! 
#Js6-17: The city and all that is in it are to be devoted "to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent. 
#Js6-18: But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it. 
#Js6-19: All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the LORD and must go into his treasury." 
#Js6-20: When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so everyone charged straight in, and they took the city. 
#Js6-21: They devoted the city to the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it —men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys. 
#Js6-22: Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her." 
#Js6-23: So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother, her brothers and sisters and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel. 
#Js6-24: Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD's house. 
#Js6-25: But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho —and she lives among the Israelites to this day. 
#Js6-26: At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: "Cursed before the LORD is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: "At the cost of his firstborn son he will lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates." 
#Js6-27: So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.
 JOSUÉ 7
#Js7-1: But the Israelites were unfaithful in regard to the devoted things "; Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, "the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the LORD's anger burned against Israel. 
#Js7-2: Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, "Go up and spy out the region." So the men went up and spied out Ai. 
#Js7-3: When they returned to Joshua, they said, "Not all the army will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary the whole army, for only a few people live there." 
#Js7-4: So about three thousand went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai, 
#Js7-5: who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted in fear and became like water. 
#Js7-6: Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the LORD, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads. 
#Js7-7: And Joshua said, "Alas, Sovereign LORD, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan! 
#Js7-8: Pardon your servant, Lord. What can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies? 
#Js7-9: The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?" 
#Js7-10: The LORD said to Joshua, "Stand up! What are you doing down on your face? 
#Js7-11: Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions. 
#Js7-12: That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction. 
#Js7-13: "Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: There are devoted things among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them. 
#Js7-14: "'In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the LORD chooses shall come forward clan by clan; the clan the LORD chooses shall come forward family by family; and the family the LORD chooses shall come forward man by man. 
#Js7-15: Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the LORD and has done an outrageous thing in Israel!'" 
#Js7-16: Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was chosen. 
#Js7-17: The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were chosen. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was chosen. 
#Js7-18: Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen. 
#Js7-19: Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and honor him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me." 
#Js7-20: Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I have done: 
#Js7-21: When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, "two hundred shekels "of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, "I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath." 
#Js7-22: So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. 
#Js7-23: They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the LORD. 
#Js7-24: Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor. 
#Js7-25: Joshua said, "Why have you brought this trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today." Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them. 
#Js7-26: Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor "ever since.
 JOSUÉ 8
#Js8-1: Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land. 
#Js8-2: You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city." 
#Js8-3: So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night 
#Js8-4: with these orders: "Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don't go very far from it. All of you be on the alert. 
#Js8-5: I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them. 
#Js8-6: They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are running away from us as they did before.' So when we flee from them, 
#Js8-7: you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The LORD your God will give it into your hand. 
#Js8-8: When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the LORD has commanded. See to it; you have my orders." 
#Js8-9: Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai —but Joshua spent that night with the people. 
#Js8-10: Early the next morning Joshua mustered his army, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai. 
#Js8-11: The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city. 
#Js8-12: Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 
#Js8-13: So the soldiers took up their positions —with the main camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley. 
#Js8-14: When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city. 
#Js8-15: Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness. 
#Js8-16: All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city. 
#Js8-17: Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel. 
#Js8-18: Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city." So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin that was in his hand. 
#Js8-19: As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire. 
#Js8-20: The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising up into the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction; the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the wilderness had turned back against their pursuers. 
#Js8-21: For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from it, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai. 
#Js8-22: Those in the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives. 
#Js8-23: But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua. 
#Js8-24: When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it. 
#Js8-25: Twelve thousand men and women fell that day —all the people of Ai. 
#Js8-26: For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed "all who lived in Ai. 
#Js8-27: But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the LORD had instructed Joshua. 
#Js8-28: So Joshua burned Ai "and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day. 
#Js8-29: He impaled the body of the king of Ai on a pole and left it there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take the body from the pole and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day. 
#Js8-30: Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, 
#Js8-31: as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses —an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the LORD burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings. 
#Js8-32: There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses. 
#Js8-33: All the Israelites, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD, facing the Levitical priests who carried it. Both the foreigners living among them and the native-born were there. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel. 
#Js8-34: Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law —the blessings and the curses —just as it is written in the Book of the Law. 
#Js8-35: There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the foreigners who lived among them.
 JOSUÉ 9
#Js9-1: Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things —the kings in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Mediterranean Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites) — 
#Js9-2: they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel. 
#Js9-3: However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
#Js9-4: they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded "with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended. 
#Js9-5: They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy. 
#Js9-6: Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites, "We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us." 
#Js9-7: The Israelites said to the Hivites, "But perhaps you live near us, so how can we make a treaty with you?" 
#Js9-8: "We are your servants," they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, "Who are you and where do you come from?" 
#Js9-9: They answered: "Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard reports of him: all that he did in Egypt, 
#Js9-10: and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan —Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. 
#Js9-11: And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, 'Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, "We are your servants; make a treaty with us."' 
#Js9-12: This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is. 
#Js9-13: And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey." 
#Js9-14: The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD. 
#Js9-15: Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath. 
#Js9-16: Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them. 
#Js9-17: So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim. 
#Js9-18: But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders, 
#Js9-19: but all the leaders answered, "We have given them our oath by the LORD, the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now. 
#Js9-20: This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that God's wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them." 
#Js9-21: They continued, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers in the service of the whole assembly." So the leaders' promise to them was kept. 
#Js9-22: Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you deceive us by saying, 'We live a long way from you,' while actually you live near us? 
#Js9-23: You are now under a curse: You will never be released from service as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God." 
#Js9-24: They answered Joshua, "Your servants were clearly told how the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this. 
#Js9-25: We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you." 
#Js9-26: So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them. 
#Js9-27: That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the assembly, to provide for the needs of the altar of the LORD at the place the LORD would choose. And that is what they are to this day.
 JOSUÉ 10
#Js10-1: Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed "it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and had become their allies. 
#Js10-2: He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters. 
#Js10-3: So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon. 
#Js10-4: "Come up and help me attack Gibeon," he said, "because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites." 
#Js10-5: Then the five kings of the Amorites —the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon —joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it. 
#Js10-6: The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us." 
#Js10-7: So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men. 
#Js10-8: The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you." 
#Js10-9: After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise. 
#Js10-10: The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, so Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. 
#Js10-11: As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them, and more of them died from the hail than were killed by the swords of the Israelites. 
#Js10-12: On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: "Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon." 
#Js10-13: So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on "its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day. 
#Js10-14: There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a human being. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel! 
#Js10-15: Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal. 
#Js10-16: Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
#Js10-17: When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah, 
#Js10-18: he said, "Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it. 
#Js10-19: But don't stop; pursue your enemies! Attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand." 
#Js10-20: So Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely, but a few survivors managed to reach their fortified cities. 
#Js10-21: The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites. 
#Js10-22: Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me." 
#Js10-23: So they brought the five kings out of the cave —the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. 
#Js10-24: When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, "Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks. 
#Js10-25: Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight." 
#Js10-26: Then Joshua put the kings to death and exposed their bodies on five poles, and they were left hanging on the poles until evening. 
#Js10-27: At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the poles and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day. 
#Js10-28: That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho. 
#Js10-29: Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it. 
#Js10-30: The LORD also gave that city and its king into Israel's hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho. 
#Js10-31: Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it. 
#Js10-32: The LORD gave Lachish into Israel's hands, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah. 
#Js10-33: Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army —until no survivors were left. 
#Js10-34: Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it. 
#Js10-35: They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish. 
#Js10-36: Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it. 
#Js10-37: They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it. 
#Js10-38: Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir. 
#Js10-39: They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron. 
#Js10-40: So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded. 
#Js10-41: Joshua subdued them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon. 
#Js10-42: All these kings and their lands Joshua conquered in one campaign, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. 
#Js10-43: Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
 JOSUÉ 11
#Js11-1: When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Akshaph, 
#Js11-2: and to the northern kings who were in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor on the west; 
#Js11-3: to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites below Hermon in the region of Mizpah. 
#Js11-4: They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots —a huge army, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 
#Js11-5: All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel. 
#Js11-6: The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, because by this time tomorrow I will hand all of them, slain, over to Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots." 
#Js11-7: So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them, 
#Js11-8: and the LORD gave them into the hand of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon, to Misrephoth Maim, and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east, until no survivors were left. 
#Js11-9: Joshua did to them as the LORD had directed: He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots. 
#Js11-10: At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword. (Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.) 
#Js11-11: Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed "them, not sparing anyone that breathed, and he burned Hazor itself. 
#Js11-12: Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded. 
#Js11-13: Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds —except Hazor, which Joshua burned. 
#Js11-14: The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed. 
#Js11-15: As the LORD commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses. 
#Js11-16: So Joshua took this entire land: the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills, 
#Js11-17: from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and put them to death. 
#Js11-18: Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time. 
#Js11-19: Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites, who took them all in battle. 
#Js11-20: For it was the LORD himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
#Js11-21: At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns. 
#Js11-22: No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive. 
#Js11-23: So Joshua took the entire land, just as the LORD had directed Moses, and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. Then the land had rest from war.
 JOSUÉ 12

#Js13-2: "This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and Geshurites, 
#Js13-3: from the Shihor River on the east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north, all of it counted as Canaanite though held by the five Philistine rulers in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron; the territory of the Avvites

#Js13-6: "As for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, that is, all the Sidonians, I myself will drive them out before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate this land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have instructed you, 
#Js13-7: and divide it as an inheritance among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh."

#Js13-9: It extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and included the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon,

#Js13-13: But the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maakah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day. 
#Js13-14: But to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance, since the food offerings presented to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as he promised them. 
#Js13-15: This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Reuben, according to its clans: 
#Js13-16: The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and the whole plateau past Medeba

#Js13-20: Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth — 
#Js13-21: all the towns on the plateau and the entire realm of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled at Heshbon. Moses had defeated him and the Midianite chiefs, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba —princes allied with Sihon —who lived in that country. 
#Js13-22: In addition to those slain in battle, the Israelites had put to the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination.

 JOSUÉ 14

#Js14-2: Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine and a half tribes, as the LORD had commanded through Moses. 
#Js14-3: Moses had granted the two and a half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest, 
#Js14-4: for Joseph's descendants had become two tribes —Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds. 
#Js14-5: So the Israelites divided the land, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
#Js14-6: Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me. 
#Js14-7: I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions, 
#Js14-8: but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear. I, however, followed the LORD my God wholeheartedly. 
#Js14-9: So on that day Moses swore to me, 'The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God wholeheartedly.' [^1] 
#Js14-10: "Now then, just as the LORD promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old! 
#Js14-11: I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then. 
#Js14-12: Now give me this hill country that the LORD promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the LORD helping me, I will drive them out just as he said." 
#Js14-13: Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. 
#Js14-14: So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the LORD, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly. 
#Js14-15: (Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakites.) Then the land had rest from war.

#Js15-15: From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).

#Js15-18: One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him "to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?"

#Js16-3: descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the Mediterranean Sea. 
#Js16-4: So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance. 
#Js16-5: This was the territory of Ephraim, according to its clans: The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon 
#Js16-6: and continued to the Mediterranean Sea. From Mikmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east. 
#Js16-7: Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.

 JOSUÉ 17
#Js17-1: This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph's firstborn, that is, for Makir, Manasseh's firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because the Makirites were great soldiers. 
#Js17-2: So this allotment was for the rest of the people of Manasseh —the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans. 
#Js17-3: Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah. 
#Js17-4: They went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives." So Joshua gave them an inheritance along with the brothers of their father, according to the LORD's command. 
#Js17-5: Manasseh's share consisted of ten tracts of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan, 
#Js17-6: because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh. 
#Js17-7: The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Mikmethath east of Shechem. The boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at En Tappuah. 
#Js17-8: (Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah itself, on the boundary of Manasseh, belonged to the Ephraimites.) 
#Js17-9: Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine. There were towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh, but the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.

#Js17-12: Yet the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that region. 
#Js17-13: However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely. 
#Js17-14: The people of Joseph said to Joshua, "Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people, and the LORD has blessed us abundantly." 
#Js17-15: "If you are so numerous," Joshua answered, "and if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites." 
#Js17-16: The people of Joseph replied, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots fitted with iron, both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel." 
#Js17-17: But Joshua said to the tribes of Joseph —to Ephraim and Manasseh —"You are numerous and very powerful. You will have not only one allotment 
#Js17-18: but the forested hill country as well. Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours; though the Canaanites have chariots fitted with iron and though they are strong, you can drive them out."
 JOSUÉ 18
#Js18-1: The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The country was brought under their control, 
#Js18-2: but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance. 
#Js18-3: So Joshua said to the Israelites: "How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has given you? 
#Js18-4: Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me. 
#Js18-5: You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the tribes of Joseph in their territory on the north. 
#Js18-6: After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the LORD our God. 
#Js18-7: The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to them." 
#Js18-8: As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, "Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD." 
#Js18-9: So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh. 
#Js18-10: Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions. 
#Js18-11: The first lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin according to its clans. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph: 
#Js18-12: On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out at the wilderness of Beth Aven. 
#Js18-13: From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon. 
#Js18-14: From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side. 
#Js18-15: The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. 
#Js18-16: The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel. 
#Js18-17: It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
#Js18-18: It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah "and on down into the Arabah. 
#Js18-19: It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary. 
#Js18-20: The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides. 
#Js18-21: The tribe of Benjamin, according to its clans, had the following towns: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, 
#Js18-22: Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
#Js18-23: Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
#Js18-24: Kephar Ammoni, Ophni and Geba —twelve towns and their villages.

#Js18-26: Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah, 
#Js18-27: Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
#Js18-28: Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath —fourteen towns and their villages. This was the inheritance of Benjamin for its clans.

#Js19-8: and all the villages around these towns as far as Baalath Beer (Ramah in the Negev). This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Simeonites, according to its clans. 
#Js19-9: The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the share of Judah, because Judah's portion was more than they needed. So the Simeonites received their inheritance within the territory of Judah. 
#Js19-10: The third lot came up for Zebulun according to its clans: The boundary of their inheritance went as far as Sarid. 
#Js19-11: Going west it ran to Maralah, touched Dabbesheth, and extended to the ravine near Jokneam.

#Js19-24: The fifth lot came out for the tribe of Asher according to its clans. 
#Js19-25: Their territory included: Helkath, Hali, Beten, Akshaph,

#Js19-28: It went to Abdon, "Rehob, Hammon and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon. 
#Js19-29: The boundary then turned back toward Ramah and went to the fortified city of Tyre, turned toward Hosah and came out at the Mediterranean Sea in the region of Akzib,

#Js19-47: (When the territory of the Danites was lost to them, they went up and attacked Leshem, took it, put it to the sword and occupied it. They settled in Leshem and named it Dan after their ancestor.) 
#Js19-48: These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, according to its clans. 
#Js19-49: When they had finished dividing the land into its allotted portions, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them, 
#Js19-50: as the LORD had commanded. They gave him the town he asked for —Timnath Serah "in the hill country of Ephraim. And he built up the town and settled there. 
#Js19-51: These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting. And so they finished dividing the land.
 JOSUÉ 20
#Js20-1: Then the LORD said to Joshua: 
#Js20-2: "Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses, 
#Js20-3: so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and unintentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood. 
#Js20-4: When they flee to one of these cities, they are to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state their case before the elders of that city. Then the elders are to admit the fugitive into their city and provide a place to live among them. 
#Js20-5: If the avenger of blood comes in pursuit, the elders must not surrender the fugitive, because the fugitive killed their neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought. 
#Js20-6: They are to stay in that city until they have stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then they may go back to their own home in the town from which they fled." 
#Js20-7: So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
#Js20-8: East of the Jordan (on the other side from Jericho) they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau in the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of Manasseh. 
#Js20-9: Any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing among them who killed someone accidentally could flee to these designated cities and not be killed by the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.
 JOSUÉ 21
#Js21-1: Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the other tribal families of Israel 
#Js21-2: at Shiloh in Canaan and said to them, "The LORD commanded through Moses that you give us towns to live in, with pasturelands for our livestock." 
#Js21-3: So, as the LORD had commanded, the Israelites gave the Levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own inheritance: 
#Js21-4: The first lot came out for the Kohathites, according to their clans. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon and Benjamin. 
#Js21-5: The rest of Kohath's descendants were allotted ten towns from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan and half of Manasseh. 
#Js21-6: The descendants of Gershon were allotted thirteen towns from the clans of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. 
#Js21-7: The descendants of Merari, according to their clans, received twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun. 
#Js21-8: So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these towns and their pasturelands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses. 
#Js21-9: From the tribes of Judah and Simeon they allotted the following towns by name 
#Js21-10: (these towns were assigned to the descendants of Aaron who were from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them): 
#Js21-11: They gave them Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pastureland, in the hill country of Judah. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.) 
#Js21-12: But the fields and villages around the city they had given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession. 
#Js21-13: So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Libnah, 
#Js21-14: Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
#Js21-15: Holon, Debir, 
#Js21-16: Ain, Juttah and Beth Shemesh, together with their pasturelands —nine towns from these two tribes. 
#Js21-17: And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon, Geba, 
#Js21-18: Anathoth and Almon, together with their pasturelands —four towns. 
#Js21-19: The total number of towns for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, came to thirteen, together with their pasturelands. 
#Js21-20: The rest of the Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted towns from the tribe of Ephraim: 
#Js21-21: In the hill country of Ephraim they were given Shechem (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Gezer, 
#Js21-22: Kibzaim and Beth Horon, together with their pasturelands —four towns. 
#Js21-23: Also from the tribe of Dan they received Eltekeh, Gibbethon, 
#Js21-24: Aijalon and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands —four towns. 
#Js21-25: From half the tribe of Manasseh they received Taanach and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands —two towns. 
#Js21-26: All these ten towns and their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans. 
#Js21-27: The Levite clans of the Gershonites were given: from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Be Eshterah, together with their pasturelands —two towns; 
#Js21-28: from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion, Daberath, 
#Js21-29: Jarmuth and En Gannim, together with their pasturelands —four towns; 
#Js21-30: from the tribe of Asher, Mishal, Abdon, 
#Js21-31: Helkath and Rehob, together with their pasturelands —four towns; 
#Js21-32: from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Hammoth Dor and Kartan, together with their pasturelands —three towns. 
#Js21-33: The total number of towns of the Gershonite clans came to thirteen, together with their pasturelands. 
#Js21-34: The Merarite clans (the rest of the Levites) were given: from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam, Kartah, 
#Js21-35: Dimnah and Nahalal, together with their pasturelands —four towns; 
#Js21-36: from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer, Jahaz, 
#Js21-37: Kedemoth and Mephaath, together with their pasturelands —four towns; 
#Js21-38: from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Mahanaim, 
#Js21-39: Heshbon and Jazer, together with their pasturelands —four towns in all. 
#Js21-40: The total number of towns allotted to the Merarite clans, who were the rest of the Levites, came to twelve. 
#Js21-41: The towns of the Levites in the territory held by the Israelites were forty-eight in all, together with their pasturelands. 
#Js21-42: Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it; this was true for all these towns. 
#Js21-43: So the LORD gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give their ancestors, and they took possession of it and settled there. 
#Js21-44: The LORD gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their ancestors. Not one of their enemies withstood them; the LORD gave all their enemies into their hands. 
#Js21-45: Not one of all the LORD's good promises to Israel failed; every one was fulfilled.
 JOSUÉ 22
#Js22-1: Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh 
#Js22-2: and said to them, "You have done all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded. 
#Js22-3: For a long time now —to this very day —you have not deserted your fellow Israelites but have carried out the mission the LORD your God gave you. 
#Js22-4: Now that the LORD your God has given them rest as he promised, return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan. 
#Js22-5: But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: to love the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him, to keep his commands, to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul." 
#Js22-6: Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes. 
#Js22-7: (To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half of the tribe Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan along with their fellow Israelites.) When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them, 
#Js22-8: saying, "Return to your homes with your great wealth —with large herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze and iron, and a great quantity of clothing —and divide the plunder from your enemies with your fellow Israelites." 
#Js22-9: So the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses. 
#Js22-10: When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan. 
#Js22-11: And when the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side, 
#Js22-12: the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them. 
#Js22-13: So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead —to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
#Js22-14: With him they sent ten of the chief men, one from each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans. 
#Js22-15: When they went to Gilead —to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh —they said to them: 
#Js22-16: "The whole assembly of the LORD says: 'How could you break faith with the God of Israel like this? How could you turn away from the LORD and build yourselves an altar in rebellion against him now? 
#Js22-17: Was not the sin of Peor enough for us? Up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin, even though a plague fell on the community of the LORD! 
#Js22-18: And are you now turning away from the LORD? "'If you rebel against the LORD today, tomorrow he will be angry with the whole community of Israel. 
#Js22-19: If the land you possess is defiled, come over to the LORD's land, where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and share the land with us. But do not rebel against the LORD or against us by building an altar for yourselves, other than the altar of the LORD our God. 
#Js22-20: When Achan son of Zerah was unfaithful in regard to the devoted things, "did not wrath come on the whole community of Israel? He was not the only one who died for his sin.'" 
#Js22-21: Then Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of Israel: 
#Js22-22: "The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows! And let Israel know! If this has been in rebellion or disobedience to the LORD, do not spare us this day. 
#Js22-23: If we have built our own altar to turn away from the LORD and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may the LORD himself call us to account. 
#Js22-24: "No! We did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours, 'What do you have to do with the LORD, the God of Israel? 
#Js22-25: The LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you —you Reubenites and Gadites! You have no share in the LORD.' So your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the LORD. 
#Js22-26: "That is why we said, 'Let us get ready and build an altar —but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.' 
#Js22-27: On the contrary, it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow, that we will worship the LORD at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices and fellowship offerings. Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours, 'You have no share in the LORD.' 
#Js22-28: "And we said, 'If they ever say this to us, or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the LORD's altar, which our ancestors built, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.' 
#Js22-29: "Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD and turn away from him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings and sacrifices, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle." 
#Js22-30: When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community —the heads of the clans of the Israelites —heard what Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased. 
#Js22-31: And Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, said to Reuben, Gad and Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is with us, because you have not been unfaithful to the LORD in this matter. Now you have rescued the Israelites from the LORD's hand." 
#Js22-32: Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported to the Israelites. 
#Js22-33: They were glad to hear the report and praised God. And they talked no more about going to war against them to devastate the country where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived. 
#Js22-34: And the Reubenites and the Gadites gave the altar this name: A Witness Between Us —that the LORD is God.
 JOSUÉ 23
#Js23-1: After a long time had passed and the LORD had given Israel rest from all their enemies around them, Joshua, by then a very old man, 
#Js23-2: summoned all Israel —their elders, leaders, judges and officials —and said to them: "I am very old. 
#Js23-3: You yourselves have seen everything the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake; it was the LORD your God who fought for you. 
#Js23-4: Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes all the land of the nations that remain —the nations I conquered —between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
#Js23-5: The LORD your God himself will push them out for your sake. He will drive them out before you, and you will take possession of their land, as the LORD your God promised you. 
#Js23-6: "Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, without turning aside to the right or to the left. 
#Js23-7: Do not associate with these nations that remain among you; do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them. You must not serve them or bow down to them. 
#Js23-8: But you are to hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have until now. 
#Js23-9: "The LORD has driven out before you great and powerful nations; to this day no one has been able to withstand you. 
#Js23-10: One of you routs a thousand, because the LORD your God fights for you, just as he promised. 
#Js23-11: So be very careful to love the LORD your God. 
#Js23-12: "But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them, 
#Js23-13: then you may be sure that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become snares and traps for you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land, which the LORD your God has given you. 
#Js23-14: "Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed. 
#Js23-15: But just as all the good things the LORD your God has promised you have come to you, so he will bring on you all the evil things he has threatened, until the LORD your God has destroyed you from this good land he has given you. 
#Js23-16: If you violate the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the LORD's anger will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you."
 JOSUÉ 24
#Js24-1: Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God. 
#Js24-2: Joshua said to all the people, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Long ago your ancestors, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods. 
#Js24-3: But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac, 
#Js24-4: and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his family went down to Egypt. 
#Js24-5: "'Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and I brought you out. 
#Js24-6: When I brought your people out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen "as far as the Red Sea. [^2] 
#Js24-7: But they cried to the LORD for help, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians; he brought the sea over them and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time. 
#Js24-8: "'I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land. 
#Js24-9: When Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you. 
#Js24-10: But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand. 
#Js24-11: "'Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands. 
#Js24-12: I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you —also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow. 
#Js24-13: So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.' 
#Js24-14: "Now fear the LORD and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. 
#Js24-15: But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD." 
#Js24-16: Then the people answered, "Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods! 
#Js24-17: It was the LORD our God himself who brought us and our parents up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled. 
#Js24-18: And the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. We too will serve the LORD, because he is our God." 
#Js24-19: Joshua said to the people, "You are not able to serve the LORD. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins. 
#Js24-20: If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you." 
#Js24-21: But the people said to Joshua, "No! We will serve the LORD." 
#Js24-22: Then Joshua said, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD." "Yes, we are witnesses," they replied. 
#Js24-23: "Now then," said Joshua, "throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel." 
#Js24-24: And the people said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God and obey him." 
#Js24-25: On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he reaffirmed for them decrees and laws. 
#Js24-26: And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the LORD. 
#Js24-27: "See!" he said to all the people. "This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the LORD has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God." 
#Js24-28: Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to their own inheritance. 
#Js24-29: After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten. 
#Js24-30: And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah "in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
#Js24-31: Israel served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the LORD had done for Israel. 
#Js24-32: And Joseph's bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver "from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph's descendants. 
#Js24-33: And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
JUÍZES
 JUÍZES 1
#Jz1-1: After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the LORD, "Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Canaanites?" 
#Jz1-2: The LORD answered, "Judah shall go up; I have given the land into their hands." 
#Jz1-3: The men of Judah then said to the Simeonites their fellow Israelites, "Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours." So the Simeonites went with them. 
#Jz1-4: When Judah attacked, the LORD gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek. 
#Jz1-5: It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites. 
#Jz1-6: Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
#Jz1-7: Then Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. 
#Jz1-8: The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire. 
#Jz1-9: After that, Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills. 
#Jz1-10: They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai. 
#Jz1-11: From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher). 
#Jz1-12: And Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher." 
#Jz1-13: Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage. 
#Jz1-14: One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him "to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?" 
#Jz1-15: She replied, "Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs. 
#Jz1-16: The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms "with the people of Judah to live among the inhabitants of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad. 
#Jz1-17: Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their fellow Israelites and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed "the city. Therefore it was called Hormah. [^4] 
#Jz1-18: Judah also took "Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron —each city with its territory. 
#Jz1-19: The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had chariots fitted with iron. 
#Jz1-20: As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak. 
#Jz1-21: The Benjamites, however, did not drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites. 
#Jz1-22: Now the tribes of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them. 
#Jz1-23: When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz), 
#Jz1-24: the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, "Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well." 
#Jz1-25: So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family. 
#Jz1-26: He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day. 
#Jz1-27: But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land. 
#Jz1-28: When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely. 
#Jz1-29: Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them. 
#Jz1-30: Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, so these Canaanites lived among them, but Zebulun did subject them to forced labor. 
#Jz1-31: Nor did Asher drive out those living in Akko or Sidon or Ahlab or Akzib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob. 
#Jz1-32: The Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land because they did not drive them out. 
#Jz1-33: Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them. 
#Jz1-34: The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain. 
#Jz1-35: And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the tribes of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor. 
#Jz1-36: The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.
 JUÍZES 2
#Jz2-1: The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land I swore to give to your ancestors. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you, 
#Jz2-2: and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.' Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this? 
#Jz2-3: And I have also said, 'I will not drive them out before you; they will become traps for you, and their gods will become snares to you.'" 
#Jz2-4: When the angel of the LORD had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud, 
#Jz2-5: and they called that place Bokim. "There they offered sacrifices to the LORD. 
#Jz2-6: After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to their own inheritance. 
#Jz2-7: The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel. 
#Jz2-8: Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten. 
#Jz2-9: And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres "in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
#Jz2-10: After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation grew up who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel. 
#Jz2-11: Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals. 
#Jz2-12: They forsook the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They aroused the LORD's anger 
#Jz2-13: because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. 
#Jz2-14: In his anger against Israel the LORD gave them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist. 
#Jz2-15: Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the LORD was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress. 
#Jz2-16: Then the LORD raised up judges, "who saved them out of the hands of these raiders. 
#Jz2-17: Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors, who had been obedient to the LORD's commands. 
#Jz2-18: Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD relented because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them. 
#Jz2-19: But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways. 
#Jz2-20: Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and said, "Because this nation has violated the covenant I ordained for their ancestors and has not listened to me, 
#Jz2-21: I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died. 
#Jz2-22: I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the LORD and walk in it as their ancestors did." 
#Jz2-23: The LORD had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.
 JUÍZES 3
#Jz3-1: These are the nations the LORD left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan 
#Jz3-2: (he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience): 
#Jz3-3: the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath. 
#Jz3-4: They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the LORD's commands, which he had given their ancestors through Moses. 
#Jz3-5: The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
#Jz3-6: They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
#Jz3-7: The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs. 
#Jz3-8: The anger of the LORD burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim, "to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years. 
#Jz3-9: But when they cried out to the LORD, he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, who saved them. 
#Jz3-10: The Spirit of the LORD came on him, so that he became Israel's judge "and went to war. The LORD gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him. 
#Jz3-11: So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died. 
#Jz3-12: Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and because they did this evil the LORD gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel. 
#Jz3-13: Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms. [^3] 
#Jz3-14: The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years. 
#Jz3-15: Again the Israelites cried out to the LORD, and he gave them a deliverer —Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab. 
#Jz3-16: Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit "long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing. 
#Jz3-17: He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man. 
#Jz3-18: After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way those who had carried it. 
#Jz3-19: But on reaching the stone images near Gilgal he himself went back to Eglon and said, "Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you." The king said to his attendants, "Leave us!" And they all left. 
#Jz3-20: Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace "and said, "I have a message from God for you." As the king rose from his seat, 
#Jz3-21: Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's belly. 
#Jz3-22: Even the handle sank in after the blade, and his bowels discharged. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it. 
#Jz3-23: Then Ehud went out to the porch "; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them. 
#Jz3-24: After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, "He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the palace." 
#Jz3-25: They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead. 
#Jz3-26: While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the stone images and escaped to Seirah. 
#Jz3-27: When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them. 
#Jz3-28: "Follow me," he ordered, "for the LORD has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands." So they followed him down and took possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab; they allowed no one to cross over. 
#Jz3-29: At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not one escaped. 
#Jz3-30: That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years. 
#Jz3-31: After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.
 JUÍZES 4
#Jz4-1: Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, now that Ehud was dead. 
#Jz4-2: So the LORD sold them into the hands of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. Sisera, the commander of his army, was based in Harosheth Haggoyim. 
#Jz4-3: Because he had nine hundred chariots fitted with iron and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried to the LORD for help. 
#Jz4-4: Now Deborah, a prophet, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading "Israel at that time. 
#Jz4-5: She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her to have their disputes decided. 
#Jz4-6: She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, "The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you: 'Go, take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them up to Mount Tabor. 
#Jz4-7: I will lead Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands.'" 
#Jz4-8: Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you don't go with me, I won't go." 
#Jz4-9: "Certainly I will go with you," said Deborah. "But because of the course you are taking, the honor will not be yours, for the LORD will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh. 
#Jz4-10: There Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali, and ten thousand men went up under his command. Deborah also went up with him. 
#Jz4-11: Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, "and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh. 
#Jz4-12: When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, 
#Jz4-13: Sisera summoned from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River all his men and his nine hundred chariots fitted with iron. 
#Jz4-14: Then Deborah said to Barak, "Go! This is the day the LORD has given Sisera into your hands. Has not the LORD gone ahead of you?" So Barak went down Mount Tabor, with ten thousand men following him. 
#Jz4-15: At Barak's advance, the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot. 
#Jz4-16: Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all Sisera's troops fell by the sword; not a man was left. 
#Jz4-17: Sisera, meanwhile, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was an alliance between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite. 
#Jz4-18: Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Come, my lord, come right in. Don't be afraid." So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket. 
#Jz4-19: "I'm thirsty," he said. "Please give me some water." She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up. 
#Jz4-20: "Stand in the doorway of the tent," he told her. "If someone comes by and asks you, 'Is anyone in there?' say 'No.'" 
#Jz4-21: But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died. 
#Jz4-22: Just then Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. "Come," she said, "I will show you the man you're looking for." So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple —dead. 
#Jz4-23: On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites. 
#Jz4-24: And the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him.
 JUÍZES 5
#Jz5-1: On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song: 
#Jz5-2: "When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves — praise the LORD! 
#Jz5-3: "Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I, even I, will sing to "the LORD; I will praise the LORD, the God of Israel, in song. 
#Jz5-4: "When you, LORD, went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water. 
#Jz5-5: The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel. 
#Jz5-6: "In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths. 
#Jz5-7: Villagers in Israel would not fight; they held back until I, Deborah, arose, until I arose, a mother in Israel. 
#Jz5-8: God chose new leaders when war came to the city gates, but not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel. 
#Jz5-9: My heart is with Israel's princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the LORD! 
#Jz5-10: "You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider 
#Jz5-11: the voice of the singers "at the watering places. They recite the victories of the LORD, the victories of his villagers in Israel. "Then the people of the LORD went down to the city gates. 
#Jz5-12: 'Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, Barak! Take captive your captives, son of Abinoam.' 
#Jz5-13: "The remnant of the nobles came down; the people of the LORD came down to me against the mighty. 
#Jz5-14: Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander's "staff. 
#Jz5-15: The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, sent under his command into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. 
#Jz5-16: Why did you stay among the sheep pens "to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. 
#Jz5-17: Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves. 
#Jz5-18: The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the terraced fields. 
#Jz5-19: "Kings came, they fought, the kings of Canaan fought. At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, they took no plunder of silver. 
#Jz5-20: From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera. 
#Jz5-21: The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong! 
#Jz5-22: Then thundered the horses' hooves — galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds. 
#Jz5-23: 'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD. 'Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.' 
#Jz5-24: "Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women. 
#Jz5-25: He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk. 
#Jz5-26: Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple. 
#Jz5-27: At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell —dead. 
#Jz5-28: "Through the window peered Sisera's mother; behind the lattice she cried out, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?' 
#Jz5-29: The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself, 
#Jz5-30: 'Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a woman or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck — all this as plunder?' 
#Jz5-31: "So may all your enemies perish, LORD! But may all who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength." Then the land had peace forty years.
 JUÍZES 6
#Jz6-1: The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites. 
#Jz6-2: Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. 
#Jz6-3: Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. 
#Jz6-4: They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. 
#Jz6-5: They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. 
#Jz6-6: Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the LORD for help. 
#Jz6-7: When the Israelites cried out to the LORD because of Midian, 
#Jz6-8: he sent them a prophet, who said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
#Jz6-9: I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land. 
#Jz6-10: I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me." 
#Jz6-11: The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. 
#Jz6-12: When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, "The LORD is with you, mighty warrior." 
#Jz6-13: "Pardon me, my lord," Gideon replied, "but if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian." 
#Jz6-14: The LORD turned to him and said, "Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?" 
#Jz6-15: "Pardon me, my lord," Gideon replied, "but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family." 
#Jz6-16: The LORD answered, "I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive." 
#Jz6-17: Gideon replied, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. 
#Jz6-18: Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you." And the LORD said, "I will wait until you return." 
#Jz6-19: Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah "of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. 
#Jz6-20: The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And Gideon did so. 
#Jz6-21: Then the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared. 
#Jz6-22: When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, "Alas, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!" 
#Jz6-23: But the LORD said to him, "Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die." 
#Jz6-24: So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
#Jz6-25: That same night the LORD said to him, "Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. "Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole "beside it. 
#Jz6-26: Then build a proper kind of "altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second "bull as a burnt offering." 
#Jz6-27: So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople, he did it at night rather than in the daytime. 
#Jz6-28: In the morning when the people of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar! 
#Jz6-29: They asked each other, "Who did this?" When they carefully investigated, they were told, "Gideon son of Joash did it." 
#Jz6-30: The people of the town demanded of Joash, "Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it." 
#Jz6-31: But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, "Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar." 
#Jz6-32: So because Gideon broke down Baal's altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal "that day, saying, "Let Baal contend with him." 
#Jz6-33: Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 
#Jz6-34: Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him. 
#Jz6-35: He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them. 
#Jz6-36: Gideon said to God, "If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised — 
#Jz6-37: look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said." 
#Jz6-38: And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew —a bowlful of water. 
#Jz6-39: Then Gideon said to God, "Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew." 
#Jz6-40: That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.
 JUÍZES 7
#Jz7-1: Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. 
#Jz7-2: The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many men. I cannot deliver Midian into their hands, or Israel would boast against me, 'My own strength has saved me.' 
#Jz7-3: Now announce to the army, 'Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.'" So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained. 
#Jz7-4: But the LORD said to Gideon, "There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will thin them out for you there. If I say, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go; but if I say, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go." 
#Jz7-5: So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the LORD told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink." 
#Jz7-6: Three hundred of them drank from cupped hands, lapping like dogs. All the rest got down on their knees to drink. 
#Jz7-7: The LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the others go home." 
#Jz7-8: So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley. 
#Jz7-9: During that night the LORD said to Gideon, "Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands. 
#Jz7-10: If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah 
#Jz7-11: and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp." So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp. 
#Jz7-12: The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore. 
#Jz7-13: Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. "I had a dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed." 
#Jz7-14: His friend responded, "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands." 
#Jz7-15: When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, "Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into your hands." 
#Jz7-16: Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside. 
#Jz7-17: "Watch me," he told them. "Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do. 
#Jz7-18: When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'" 
#Jz7-19: Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands. 
#Jz7-20: The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!" 
#Jz7-21: While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled. 
#Jz7-22: When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath. 
#Jz7-23: Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites. 
#Jz7-24: Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah." So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they seized the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah. 
#Jz7-25: They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.
 JUÍZES 8
#Jz8-1: Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, "Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?" And they challenged him vigorously. 
#Jz8-2: But he answered them, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer? 
#Jz8-3: God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?" At this, their resentment against him subsided. 
#Jz8-4: Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it. 
#Jz8-5: He said to the men of Sukkoth, "Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian." 
#Jz8-6: But the officials of Sukkoth said, "Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?" 
#Jz8-7: Then Gideon replied, "Just for that, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers." 
#Jz8-8: From there he went up to Peniel "and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Sukkoth had. 
#Jz8-9: So he said to the men of Peniel, "When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower." 
#Jz8-10: Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen. 
#Jz8-11: Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the unsuspecting army. 
#Jz8-12: Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army. 
#Jz8-13: Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres. 
#Jz8-14: He caught a young man of Sukkoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Sukkoth, the elders of the town. 
#Jz8-15: Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, 'Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?'" 
#Jz8-16: He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers. 
#Jz8-17: He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town. 
#Jz8-18: Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?" "Men like you," they answered, "each one with the bearing of a prince." 
#Jz8-19: Gideon replied, "Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the LORD lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you." 
#Jz8-20: Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, "Kill them!" But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid. 
#Jz8-21: Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Come, do it yourself. 'As is the man, so is his strength.'" So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels' necks. 
#Jz8-22: The Israelites said to Gideon, "Rule over us —you, your son and your grandson —because you have saved us from the hand of Midian." 
#Jz8-23: But Gideon told them, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The LORD will rule over you." 
#Jz8-24: And he said, "I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder." (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.) 
#Jz8-25: They answered, "We'll be glad to give them." So they spread out a garment, and each of them threw a ring from his plunder onto it. 
#Jz8-26: The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, "not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels' necks. 
#Jz8-27: Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. 
#Jz8-28: Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon's lifetime, the land had peace forty years. 
#Jz8-29: Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live. 
#Jz8-30: He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives. 
#Jz8-31: His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelek. 
#Jz8-32: Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
#Jz8-33: No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god 
#Jz8-34: and did not remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side. 
#Jz8-35: They also failed to show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) in spite of all the good things he had done for them.
 JUÍZES 9
#Jz9-1: Abimelek son of Jerub-Baal went to his mother's brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mother's clan, 
#Jz9-2: "Ask all the citizens of Shechem, 'Which is better for you: to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal's sons rule over you, or just one man?' Remember, I am your flesh and blood." 
#Jz9-3: When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelek, for they said, "He is related to us." 
#Jz9-4: They gave him seventy shekels "of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelek used it to hire reckless scoundrels, who became his followers. 
#Jz9-5: He went to his father's home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal, escaped by hiding. 
#Jz9-6: Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelek king. 
#Jz9-7: When Jotham was told about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, "Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you. 
#Jz9-8: One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Be our king.' 
#Jz9-9: "But the olive tree answered, 'Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?' 
#Jz9-10: "Next, the trees said to the fig tree, 'Come and be our king.' 
#Jz9-11: "But the fig tree replied, 'Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?' 
#Jz9-12: "Then the trees said to the vine, 'Come and be our king.' 
#Jz9-13: "But the vine answered, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?' 
#Jz9-14: "Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, 'Come and be our king.' 
#Jz9-15: "The thornbush said to the trees, 'If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!' 
#Jz9-16: "Have you acted honorably and in good faith by making Abimelek king? Have you been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family? Have you treated him as he deserves? 
#Jz9-17: Remember that my father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian. 
#Jz9-18: But today you have revolted against my father's family. You have murdered his seventy sons on a single stone and have made Abimelek, the son of his female slave, king over the citizens of Shechem because he is related to you. 
#Jz9-19: So have you acted honorably and in good faith toward Jerub-Baal and his family today? If you have, may Abimelek be your joy, and may you be his, too! 
#Jz9-20: But if you have not, let fire come out from Abimelek and consume you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelek!" 
#Jz9-21: Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelek. 
#Jz9-22: After Abimelek had governed Israel three years, 
#Jz9-23: God stirred up animosity between Abimelek and the citizens of Shechem so that they acted treacherously against Abimelek. 
#Jz9-24: God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal's seventy sons, the shedding of their blood, might be avenged on their brother Abimelek and on the citizens of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers. 
#Jz9-25: In opposition to him these citizens of Shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and this was reported to Abimelek. 
#Jz9-26: Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his clan into Shechem, and its citizens put their confidence in him. 
#Jz9-27: After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them, they held a festival in the temple of their god. While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelek. 
#Jz9-28: Then Gaal son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelek, and why should we Shechemites be subject to him? Isn't he Jerub-Baal's son, and isn't Zebul his deputy? Serve the family of Hamor, Shechem's father! Why should we serve Abimelek? 
#Jz9-29: If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelek, 'Call out your whole army!'" [^2] 
#Jz9-30: When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry. 
#Jz9-31: Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelek, saying, "Gaal son of Ebed and his clan have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you. 
#Jz9-32: Now then, during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields. 
#Jz9-33: In the morning at sunrise, advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, seize the opportunity to attack them." 
#Jz9-34: So Abimelek and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies. 
#Jz9-35: Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelek and his troops came out from their hiding place. 
#Jz9-36: When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!" Zebul replied, "You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men." 
#Jz9-37: But Gaal spoke up again: "Look, people are coming down from the central hill, "and a company is coming from the direction of the diviners' tree." 
#Jz9-38: Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your big talk now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelek that we should be subject to him?' Aren't these the men you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!" 
#Jz9-39: So Gaal led out "the citizens of Shechem and fought Abimelek. 
#Jz9-40: Abimelek chased him all the way to the entrance of the gate, and many were killed as they fled. 
#Jz9-41: Then Abimelek stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his clan out of Shechem. 
#Jz9-42: The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelek. 
#Jz9-43: So he took his men, divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose to attack them. 
#Jz9-44: Abimelek and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance of the city gate. Then two companies attacked those in the fields and struck them down. 
#Jz9-45: All that day Abimelek pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it. 
#Jz9-46: On hearing this, the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith. 
#Jz9-47: When Abimelek heard that they had assembled there, 
#Jz9-48: he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some branches, which he lifted to his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, "Quick! Do what you have seen me do!" 
#Jz9-49: So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire with the people still inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died. 
#Jz9-50: Next Abimelek went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it. 
#Jz9-51: Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women —all the people of the city —had fled. They had locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof. 
#Jz9-52: Abimelek went to the tower and attacked it. But as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire, 
#Jz9-53: a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull. 
#Jz9-54: Hurriedly he called to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that they can't say, 'A woman killed him.'" So his servant ran him through, and he died. 
#Jz9-55: When the Israelites saw that Abimelek was dead, they went home. 
#Jz9-56: Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelek had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers. 
#Jz9-57: God also made the people of Shechem pay for all their wickedness. The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them.
 JUÍZES 10
#Jz10-1: After the time of Abimelek, a man of Issachar named Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. 
#Jz10-2: He led "Israel twenty-three years; then he died, and was buried in Shamir. 
#Jz10-3: He was followed by Jair of Gilead, who led Israel twenty-two years. 
#Jz10-4: He had thirty sons, who rode thirty donkeys. They controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth Jair. [^2] 
#Jz10-5: When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon. 
#Jz10-6: Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD. They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines. And because the Israelites forsook the LORD and no longer served him, 
#Jz10-7: he became angry with them. He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites, 
#Jz10-8: who that year shattered and crushed them. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites. 
#Jz10-9: The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim; Israel was in great distress. 
#Jz10-10: Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, "We have sinned against you, forsaking our God and serving the Baals." 
#Jz10-11: The LORD replied, "When the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines, 
#Jz10-12: the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites "oppressed you and you cried to me for help, did I not save you from their hands? 
#Jz10-13: But you have forsaken me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you. 
#Jz10-14: Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you when you are in trouble!" 
#Jz10-15: But the Israelites said to the LORD, "We have sinned. Do with us whatever you think best, but please rescue us now." 
#Jz10-16: Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the LORD. And he could bear Israel's misery no longer. 
#Jz10-17: When the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah. 
#Jz10-18: The leaders of the people of Gilead said to each other, "Whoever will take the lead in attacking the Ammonites will be head over all who live in Gilead."
 JUÍZES 11
#Jz11-1: Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead; his mother was a prostitute. 
#Jz11-2: Gilead's wife also bore him sons, and when they were grown up, they drove Jephthah away. "You are not going to get any inheritance in our family," they said, "because you are the son of another woman." 
#Jz11-3: So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a gang of scoundrels gathered around him and followed him. 
#Jz11-4: Some time later, when the Ammonites were fighting against Israel, 
#Jz11-5: the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
#Jz11-6: "Come," they said, "be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites." 
#Jz11-7: Jephthah said to them, "Didn't you hate me and drive me from my father's house? Why do you come to me now, when you're in trouble?" 
#Jz11-8: The elders of Gilead said to him, "Nevertheless, we are turning to you now; come with us to fight the Ammonites, and you will be head over all of us who live in Gilead." 
#Jz11-9: Jephthah answered, "Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me —will I really be your head?" 
#Jz11-10: The elders of Gilead replied, "The LORD is our witness; we will certainly do as you say." 
#Jz11-11: So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And he repeated all his words before the LORD in Mizpah. 
#Jz11-12: Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: "What do you have against me that you have attacked my country?" 
#Jz11-13: The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah's messengers, "When Israel came up out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peaceably." 
#Jz11-14: Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king, 
#Jz11-15: saying: "This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. 
#Jz11-16: But when they came up out of Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea "and on to Kadesh. 
#Jz11-17: Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Give us permission to go through your country,' but the king of Edom would not listen. They sent also to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh. 
#Jz11-18: "Next they traveled through the wilderness, skirted the lands of Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of the country of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border. 
#Jz11-19: "Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, 'Let us pass through your country to our own place.' 
#Jz11-20: Sihon, however, did not trust Israel "to pass through his territory. He mustered all his troops and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel. 
#Jz11-21: "Then the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and his whole army into Israel's hands, and they defeated them. Israel took over all the land of the Amorites who lived in that country, 
#Jz11-22: capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan. 
#Jz11-23: "Now since the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, what right have you to take it over? 
#Jz11-24: Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the LORD our God has given us, we will possess. 
#Jz11-25: Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them? 
#Jz11-26: For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon. Why didn't you retake them during that time? 
#Jz11-27: I have not wronged you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. Let the LORD, the Judge, decide the dispute this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites." 
#Jz11-28: The king of Ammon, however, paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him. 
#Jz11-29: Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites. 
#Jz11-30: And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD: "If you give the Ammonites into my hands, 
#Jz11-31: whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the LORD's, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering." 
#Jz11-32: Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into his hands. 
#Jz11-33: He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon. 
#Jz11-34: When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. 
#Jz11-35: When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, "Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the LORD that I cannot break." 
#Jz11-36: "My father," she replied, "you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me just as you promised, now that the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites. 
#Jz11-37: But grant me this one request," she said. "Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry." 
#Jz11-38: "You may go," he said. And he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry. 
#Jz11-39: After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin. From this comes the Israelite tradition 
#Jz11-40: that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
 JUÍZES 12
#Jz12-1: The Ephraimite forces were called out, and they crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, "Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We're going to burn down your house over your head." 
#Jz12-2: Jephthah answered, "I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I called, you didn't save me out of their hands. 
#Jz12-3: When I saw that you wouldn't help, I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave me the victory over them. Now why have you come up today to fight me?" 
#Jz12-4: Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, "You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh." 
#Jz12-5: The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, "Let me cross over," the men of Gilead asked him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he replied, "No," 
#Jz12-6: they said, "All right, say 'Shibboleth.'" If he said, "Sibboleth," because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time. 
#Jz12-7: Jephthah led "Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in a town in Gilead. 
#Jz12-8: After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel. 
#Jz12-9: He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters away in marriage to those outside his clan, and for his sons he brought in thirty young women as wives from outside his clan. Ibzan led Israel seven years. 
#Jz12-10: Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem. 
#Jz12-11: After him, Elon the Zebulunite led Israel ten years. 
#Jz12-12: Then Elon died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. 
#Jz12-13: After him, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, led Israel. 
#Jz12-14: He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel eight years. 
#Jz12-15: Then Abdon son of Hillel died and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
 JUÍZES 13
#Jz13-1: Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, so the LORD delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years. 
#Jz13-2: A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth. 
#Jz13-3: The angel of the LORD appeared to her and said, "You are barren and childless, but you are going to become pregnant and give birth to a son. 
#Jz13-4: Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean. 
#Jz13-5: You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb. He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines." 
#Jz13-6: Then the woman went to her husband and told him, "A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn't ask him where he came from, and he didn't tell me his name. 
#Jz13-7: But he said to me, 'You will become pregnant and have a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death.'" 
#Jz13-8: Then Manoah prayed to the LORD: "Pardon your servant, Lord. I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born." 
#Jz13-9: God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. 
#Jz13-10: The woman hurried to tell her husband, "He's here! The man who appeared to me the other day!" 
#Jz13-11: Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, "Are you the man who talked to my wife?" "I am," he said. 
#Jz13-12: So Manoah asked him, "When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule that governs the boy's life and work?" 
#Jz13-13: The angel of the LORD answered, "Your wife must do all that I have told her. 
#Jz13-14: She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her." 
#Jz13-15: Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you." 
#Jz13-16: The angel of the LORD replied, "Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD." (Manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the LORD.) 
#Jz13-17: Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?" 
#Jz13-18: He replied, "Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding. "" 
#Jz13-19: Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the LORD. And the LORD did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched: 
#Jz13-20: As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground. 
#Jz13-21: When the angel of the LORD did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the LORD. 
#Jz13-22: "We are doomed to die!" he said to his wife. "We have seen God!" 
#Jz13-23: But his wife answered, "If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this." 
#Jz13-24: The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson. He grew and the LORD blessed him, 
#Jz13-25: and the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
 JUÍZES 14
#Jz14-1: Samson went down to Timnah and saw there a young Philistine woman. 
#Jz14-2: When he returned, he said to his father and mother, "I have seen a Philistine woman in Timnah; now get her for me as my wife." 
#Jz14-3: His father and mother replied, "Isn't there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me. She's the right one for me." 
#Jz14-4: (His parents did not know that this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines; for at that time they were ruling over Israel.) 
#Jz14-5: Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him. 
#Jz14-6: The Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done. 
#Jz14-7: Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her. 
#Jz14-8: Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion's carcass, and in it he saw a swarm of bees and some honey. 
#Jz14-9: He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion's carcass. 
#Jz14-10: Now his father went down to see the woman. And there Samson held a feast, as was customary for young men. 
#Jz14-11: When the people saw him, they chose thirty men to be his companions. 
#Jz14-12: "Let me tell you a riddle," Samson said to them. "If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes. 
#Jz14-13: If you can't tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes." "Tell us your riddle," they said. "Let's hear it." 
#Jz14-14: He replied, "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet." For three days they could not give the answer. 
#Jz14-15: On the fourth "day, they said to Samson's wife, "Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father's household to death. Did you invite us here to steal our property?" 
#Jz14-16: Then Samson's wife threw herself on him, sobbing, "You hate me! You don't really love me. You've given my people a riddle, but you haven't told me the answer." "I haven't even explained it to my father or mother," he replied, "so why should I explain it to you?" 
#Jz14-17: She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people. 
#Jz14-18: Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" Samson said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle." 
#Jz14-19: Then the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him. He went down to Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of everything and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger, he returned to his father's home. 
#Jz14-20: And Samson's wife was given to one of his companions who had attended him at the feast.
 JUÍZES 15
#Jz15-1: Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said, "I'm going to my wife's room." But her father would not let him go in. 
#Jz15-2: "I was so sure you hated her," he said, "that I gave her to your companion. Isn't her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead." 
#Jz15-3: Samson said to them, "This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them." 
#Jz15-4: So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails, 
#Jz15-5: lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves. 
#Jz15-6: When the Philistines asked, "Who did this?" they were told, "Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife was given to his companion." So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death. 
#Jz15-7: Samson said to them, "Since you've acted like this, I swear that I won't stop until I get my revenge on you." 
#Jz15-8: He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam. 
#Jz15-9: The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi. 
#Jz15-10: The people of Judah asked, "Why have you come to fight us?" "We have come to take Samson prisoner," they answered, "to do to him as he did to us." 
#Jz15-11: Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us?" He answered, "I merely did to them what they did to me." 
#Jz15-12: They said to him, "We've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines." Samson said, "Swear to me that you won't kill me yourselves." 
#Jz15-13: "Agreed," they answered. "We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock. 
#Jz15-14: As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands. 
#Jz15-15: Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men. 
#Jz15-16: Then Samson said, "With a donkey's jawbone I have made donkeys of them. "With a donkey's jawbone I have killed a thousand men." 
#Jz15-17: When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi. [^2] 
#Jz15-18: Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD, "You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?" 
#Jz15-19: Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore, "and it is still there in Lehi. 
#Jz15-20: Samson led "Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
 JUÍZES 16
#Jz16-1: One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her. 
#Jz16-2: The people of Gaza were told, "Samson is here!" So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, "At dawn we'll kill him." 
#Jz16-3: But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron. 
#Jz16-4: Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah. 
#Jz16-5: The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, "See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels "of silver." 
#Jz16-6: So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued." 
#Jz16-7: Samson answered her, "If anyone ties me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man." 
#Jz16-8: Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him with them. 
#Jz16-9: With men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the bowstrings as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered. 
#Jz16-10: Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied." 
#Jz16-11: He said, "If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become as weak as any other man." 
#Jz16-12: So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads. 
#Jz16-13: Delilah then said to Samson, "All this time you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied." He replied, "If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I'll become as weak as any other man." So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric 
#Jz16-14: and "tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric. 
#Jz16-15: Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when you won't confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your great strength." 
#Jz16-16: With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was sick to death of it. 
#Jz16-17: So he told her everything. "No razor has ever been used on my head," he said, "because I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother's womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man." 
#Jz16-18: When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, "Come back once more; he has told me everything." So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands. 
#Jz16-19: After putting him to sleep on her lap, she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him. "And his strength left him. 
#Jz16-20: Then she called, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and thought, "I'll go out as before and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him. 
#Jz16-21: Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding grain in the prison. 
#Jz16-22: But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved. 
#Jz16-23: Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, "Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands." 
#Jz16-24: When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, "Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain." 
#Jz16-25: While they were in high spirits, they shouted, "Bring out Samson to entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars, 
#Jz16-26: Samson said to the servant who held his hand, "Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them." 
#Jz16-27: Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform. 
#Jz16-28: Then Samson prayed to the LORD, "Sovereign LORD, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes." 
#Jz16-29: Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other, 
#Jz16-30: Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived. 
#Jz16-31: Then his brothers and his father's whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led "Israel twenty years.
 JUÍZES 17
#Jz17-1: Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim 
#Jz17-2: said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels "of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse —I have that silver with me; I took it." Then his mother said, "The LORD bless you, my son!" 
#Jz17-3: When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, "I solemnly consecrate my silver to the LORD for my son to make an image overlaid with silver. I will give it back to you." 
#Jz17-4: So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels "of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used them to make the idol. And it was put in Micah's house. 
#Jz17-5: Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest. 
#Jz17-6: In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit. 
#Jz17-7: A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah, 
#Jz17-8: left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way "he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim. 
#Jz17-9: Micah asked him, "Where are you from?" "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a place to stay." 
#Jz17-10: Then Micah said to him, "Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels "of silver a year, your clothes and your food." 
#Jz17-11: So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him. 
#Jz17-12: Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house. 
#Jz17-13: And Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest."
 JUÍZES 18
#Jz18-1: In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 
#Jz18-2: So the Danites sent five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all the Danites. They told them, "Go, explore the land." So they entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night. 
#Jz18-3: When they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?" 
#Jz18-4: He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, "He has hired me and I am his priest." 
#Jz18-5: Then they said to him, "Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful." 
#Jz18-6: The priest answered them, "Go in peace. Your journey has the LORD's approval." 
#Jz18-7: So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, at peace and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous. "Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else. [^2] 
#Jz18-8: When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their fellow Danites asked them, "How did you find things?" 
#Jz18-9: They answered, "Come on, let's attack them! We have seen the land, and it is very good. Aren't you going to do something? Don't hesitate to go there and take it over. 
#Jz18-10: When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever." 
#Jz18-11: Then six hundred men of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol. 
#Jz18-12: On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan "to this day. 
#Jz18-13: From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house. 
#Jz18-14: Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their fellow Danites, "Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, some household gods and an image overlaid with silver? Now you know what to do." 
#Jz18-15: So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah's place and greeted him. 
#Jz18-16: The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate. 
#Jz18-17: The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the idol, the ephod and the household gods while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance of the gate. 
#Jz18-18: When the five men went into Micah's house and took the idol, the ephod and the household gods, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?" 
#Jz18-19: They answered him, "Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?" 
#Jz18-20: The priest was very pleased. He took the ephod, the household gods and the idol and went along with the people. 
#Jz18-21: Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left. 
#Jz18-22: When they had gone some distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites. 
#Jz18-23: As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, "What's the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?" 
#Jz18-24: He replied, "You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, 'What's the matter with you?'" 
#Jz18-25: The Danites answered, "Don't argue with us, or some of the men may get angry and attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives." 
#Jz18-26: So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home. 
#Jz18-27: Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a people at peace and secure. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city. 
#Jz18-28: There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there. 
#Jz18-29: They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel —though the city used to be called Laish. 
#Jz18-30: There the Danites set up for themselves the idol, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, "and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land. 
#Jz18-31: They continued to use the idol Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
 JUÍZES 19
#Jz19-1: In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. 
#Jz19-2: But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her parents' home in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months, 
#Jz19-3: her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her parents' home, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him. 
#Jz19-4: His father-in-law, the woman's father, prevailed on him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there. 
#Jz19-5: On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the woman's father said to his son-in-law, "Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go." 
#Jz19-6: So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the woman's father said, "Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself." 
#Jz19-7: And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night. 
#Jz19-8: On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the woman's father said, "Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!" So the two of them ate together. 
#Jz19-9: Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the woman's father, said, "Now look, it's almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home." 
#Jz19-10: But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine. 
#Jz19-11: When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, "Come, let's stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night." 
#Jz19-12: His master replied, "No. We won't go into any city whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah." 
#Jz19-13: He added, "Come, let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places." 
#Jz19-14: So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. 
#Jz19-15: There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them in for the night. 
#Jz19-16: That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the inhabitants of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields. 
#Jz19-17: When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, "Where are you going? Where did you come from?" 
#Jz19-18: He answered, "We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. "No one has taken me in for the night. 
#Jz19-19: We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants —me, the woman and the young man with us. We don't need anything." 
#Jz19-20: "You are welcome at my house," the old man said. "Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square." 
#Jz19-21: So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink. 
#Jz19-22: While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him." 
#Jz19-23: The owner of the house went outside and said to them, "No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this outrageous thing. 
#Jz19-24: Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don't do such an outrageous thing." 
#Jz19-25: But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. 
#Jz19-26: At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight. 
#Jz19-27: When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. 
#Jz19-28: He said to her, "Get up; let's go." But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home. 
#Jz19-29: When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel. 
#Jz19-30: Everyone who saw it was saying to one another, "Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Just imagine! We must do something! So speak up!"
 JUÍZES 20
#Jz20-1: Then all Israel from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came together as one and assembled before the LORD in Mizpah. 
#Jz20-2: The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God's people, four hundred thousand men armed with swords. 
#Jz20-3: (The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said, "Tell us how this awful thing happened." 
#Jz20-4: So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, "I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. 
#Jz20-5: During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died. 
#Jz20-6: I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel's inheritance, because they committed this lewd and outrageous act in Israel. 
#Jz20-7: Now, all you Israelites, speak up and tell me what you have decided to do." 
#Jz20-8: All the men rose up together as one, saying, "None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house. 
#Jz20-9: But now this is what we'll do to Gibeah: We'll go up against it in the order decided by casting lots. 
#Jz20-10: We'll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah "in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for this outrageous act done in Israel." 
#Jz20-11: So all the Israelites got together and united as one against the city. 
#Jz20-12: The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What about this awful crime that was committed among you? 
#Jz20-13: Now turn those wicked men of Gibeah over to us so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel." But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites. 
#Jz20-14: From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites. 
#Jz20-15: At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred able young men from those living in Gibeah. 
#Jz20-16: Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. 
#Jz20-17: Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fit for battle. 
#Jz20-18: The Israelites went up to Bethel "and inquired of God. They said, "Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Benjamites?" The LORD replied, "Judah shall go first." 
#Jz20-19: The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah. 
#Jz20-20: The Israelites went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah. 
#Jz20-21: The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day. 
#Jz20-22: But the Israelites encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day. 
#Jz20-23: The Israelites went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and they inquired of the LORD. They said, "Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites?" The LORD answered, "Go up against them." 
#Jz20-24: Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day. 
#Jz20-25: This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords. 
#Jz20-26: Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the LORD. They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the LORD. 
#Jz20-27: And the Israelites inquired of the LORD. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there, 
#Jz20-28: with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, "Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites, or not?" The LORD responded, "Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands." 
#Jz20-29: Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah. 
#Jz20-30: They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before. 
#Jz20-31: The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads —the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah. 
#Jz20-32: While the Benjamites were saying, "We are defeating them as before," the Israelites were saying, "Let's retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads." 
#Jz20-33: All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west "of Gibeah. [^4] 
#Jz20-34: Then ten thousand of Israel's able young men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was. 
#Jz20-35: The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords. 
#Jz20-36: Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah. 
#Jz20-37: Those who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword. 
#Jz20-38: The Israelites had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city, 
#Jz20-39: and then the Israelites would counterattack. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites (about thirty), and they said, "We are defeating them as in the first battle." 
#Jz20-40: But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the whole city going up in smoke. 
#Jz20-41: Then the Israelites counterattacked, and the Benjamites were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come on them. 
#Jz20-42: So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness, but they could not escape the battle. And the Israelites who came out of the towns cut them down there. 
#Jz20-43: They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily "overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east. 
#Jz20-44: Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters. 
#Jz20-45: As they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more. 
#Jz20-46: On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters. 
#Jz20-47: But six hundred of them turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months. 
#Jz20-48: The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.
 JUÍZES 21
#Jz21-1: The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: "Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite." 
#Jz21-2: The people went to Bethel, "where they sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly. 
#Jz21-3: "LORD, God of Israel," they cried, "why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?" 
#Jz21-4: Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. 
#Jz21-5: Then the Israelites asked, "Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the LORD?" For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah was to be put to death. 
#Jz21-6: Now the Israelites grieved for the tribe of Benjamin, their fellow Israelites. "Today one tribe is cut off from Israel," they said. 
#Jz21-7: "How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?" 
#Jz21-8: Then they asked, "Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah?" They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly. 
#Jz21-9: For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there. 
#Jz21-10: So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children. 
#Jz21-11: "This is what you are to do," they said. "Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin." 
#Jz21-12: They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan. 
#Jz21-13: Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon. 
#Jz21-14: So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them. 
#Jz21-15: The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel. 
#Jz21-16: And the elders of the assembly said, "With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left? 
#Jz21-17: The Benjamite survivors must have heirs," they said, "so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. 
#Jz21-18: We can't give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: 'Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.' 
#Jz21-19: But look, there is the annual festival of the LORD in Shiloh, which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah." 
#Jz21-20: So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards 
#Jz21-21: and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin. 
#Jz21-22: When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, 'Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.'" 
#Jz21-23: So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them. 
#Jz21-24: At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance. 
#Jz21-25: In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit.
RUTE
 RUTE 1
#Rt1-1: In the days when the judges ruled, "there was a famine in the land. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab. 
#Rt1-2: The man's name was Elimelek, his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there. 
#Rt1-3: Now Elimelek, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. 
#Rt1-4: They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, 
#Rt1-5: both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband. 
#Rt1-6: When Naomi heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. 
#Rt1-7: With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah. 
#Rt1-8: Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me. 
#Rt1-9: May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband." Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud 
#Rt1-10: and said to her, "We will go back with you to your people." 
#Rt1-11: But Naomi said, "Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? 
#Rt1-12: Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me —even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons — 
#Rt1-13: would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has turned against me!" 
#Rt1-14: At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her. 
#Rt1-15: "Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her." 
#Rt1-16: But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. 
#Rt1-17: Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me." 
#Rt1-18: When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. 
#Rt1-19: So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?" 
#Rt1-20: "Don't call me Naomi, "" she told them. "Call me Mara, "because the Almighty "has made my life very bitter. 
#Rt1-21: I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted "me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me." 
#Rt1-22: So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
 RUTE 2
#Rt2-1: Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz. 
#Rt2-2: And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor." Naomi said to her, "Go ahead, my daughter." 
#Rt2-3: So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek. 
#Rt2-4: Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "The LORD be with you!" "The LORD bless you!" they answered. 
#Rt2-5: Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, "Who does that young woman belong to?" 
#Rt2-6: The overseer replied, "She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi. 
#Rt2-7: She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter." 
#Rt2-8: So Boaz said to Ruth, "My daughter, listen to me. Don't go and glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me. 
#Rt2-9: Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled." 
#Rt2-10: At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, "Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me —a foreigner?" 
#Rt2-11: Boaz replied, "I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband —how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before. 
#Rt2-12: May the LORD repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge." 
#Rt2-13: "May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord," she said. "You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant —though I do not have the standing of one of your servants." 
#Rt2-14: At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar." When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over. 
#Rt2-15: As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, "Let her gather among the sheaves and don't reprimand her. 
#Rt2-16: Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't rebuke her." 
#Rt2-17: So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah. [^1] 
#Rt2-18: She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough. 
#Rt2-19: Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz," she said. 
#Rt2-20: "The LORD bless him!" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. "He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead." She added, "That man is our close relative; he is one of our guardian-redeemers. "" 
#Rt2-21: Then Ruth the Moabite said, "He even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'" 
#Rt2-22: Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else's field you might be harmed." 
#Rt2-23: So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
 RUTE 3
#Rt3-1: One day Ruth's mother-in-law Naomi said to her, "My daughter, I must find a home "for you, where you will be well provided for. 
#Rt3-2: Now Boaz, with whose women you have worked, is a relative of ours. Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor. 
#Rt3-3: Wash, put on perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. 
#Rt3-4: When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do." 
#Rt3-5: "I will do whatever you say," Ruth answered. 
#Rt3-6: So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do. 
#Rt3-7: When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down. 
#Rt3-8: In the middle of the night something startled the man; he turned —and there was a woman lying at his feet! 
#Rt3-9: "Who are you?" he asked. "I am your servant Ruth," she said. "Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a guardian-redeemer "of our family." 
#Rt3-10: "The LORD bless you, my daughter," he replied. "This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor. 
#Rt3-11: And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character. 
#Rt3-12: Although it is true that I am a guardian-redeemer of our family, there is another who is more closely related than I. 
#Rt3-13: Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to do his duty as your guardian-redeemer, good; let him redeem you. But if he is not willing, as surely as the LORD lives I will do it. Lie here until morning." 
#Rt3-14: So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, "No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor." 
#Rt3-15: He also said, "Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out." When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and placed the bundle on her. Then he "went back to town. 
#Rt3-16: When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "How did it go, my daughter?" Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her 
#Rt3-17: and added, "He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'" 
#Rt3-18: Then Naomi said, "Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today."
 RUTE 4
#Rt4-1: Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat down there just as the guardian-redeemer "he had mentioned came along. Boaz said, "Come over here, my friend, and sit down." So he went over and sat down. 
#Rt4-2: Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, "Sit here," and they did so. 
#Rt4-3: Then he said to the guardian-redeemer, "Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek. 
#Rt4-4: I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you "will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line." "I will redeem it," he said. 
#Rt4-5: Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the "dead man's widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property." 
#Rt4-6: At this, the guardian-redeemer said, "Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it." 
#Rt4-7: (Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.) 
#Rt4-8: So the guardian-redeemer said to Boaz, "Buy it yourself." And he removed his sandal. 
#Rt4-9: Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, "Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelek, Kilion and Mahlon. 
#Rt4-10: I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon's widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown. Today you are witnesses!" 
#Rt4-11: Then the elders and all the people at the gate said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the family of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem. 
#Rt4-12: Through the offspring the LORD gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah." 
#Rt4-13: So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he made love to her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. 
#Rt4-14: The women said to Naomi: "Praise be to the LORD, who this day has not left you without a guardian-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel! 
#Rt4-15: He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth." 
#Rt4-16: Then Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him. 
#Rt4-17: The women living there said, "Naomi has a son!" And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David. 
#Rt4-18: This, then, is the family line of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron, 
#Rt4-19: Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab, 
#Rt4-20: Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, [^4] 
#Rt4-21: Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the father of Obed, 
#Rt4-22: Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David.
1 SAMUEL
 1 SAMUEL 1
#1 Sm1-1: There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite "from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
#1 Sm1-2: He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. 
#1 Sm1-3: Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD. 
#1 Sm1-4: Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 
#1 Sm1-5: But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb. 
#1 Sm1-6: Because the LORD had closed Hannah's womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. 
#1 Sm1-7: This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. 
#1 Sm1-8: Her husband Elkanah would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?" 
#1 Sm1-9: Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the LORD's house. 
#1 Sm1-10: In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the LORD, weeping bitterly. 
#1 Sm1-11: And she made a vow, saying, "LORD Almighty, if you will only look on your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head." 
#1 Sm1-12: As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. 
#1 Sm1-13: Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk 
#1 Sm1-14: and said to her, "How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine." 
#1 Sm1-15: "Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD. 
#1 Sm1-16: Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief." 
#1 Sm1-17: Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him." 
#1 Sm1-18: She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast. 
#1 Sm1-19: Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her. 
#1 Sm1-20: So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, "saying, "Because I asked the LORD for him." 
#1 Sm1-21: When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow, 
#1 Sm1-22: Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always." [^3] 
#1 Sm1-23: "Do what seems best to you," her husband Elkanah told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his "word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him. 
#1 Sm1-24: After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, "an ephah "of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. 
#1 Sm1-25: When the bull had been sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli, 
#1 Sm1-26: and she said to him, "Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD. 
#1 Sm1-27: I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him. 
#1 Sm1-28: So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.
 1 SAMUEL 2
#1 Sm2-1: Then Hannah prayed and said: "My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn "is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. 
#1 Sm2-2: "There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. 
#1 Sm2-3: "Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed. 
#1 Sm2-4: "The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength. 
#1 Sm2-5: Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry are hungry no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. 
#1 Sm2-6: "The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up. 
#1 Sm2-7: The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts. 
#1 Sm2-8: He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. "For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; on them he has set the world. 
#1 Sm2-9: He will guard the feet of his faithful servants, but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness. "It is not by strength that one prevails; 
#1 Sm2-10: those who oppose the LORD will be broken. The Most High will thunder from heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. "He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed." 
#1 Sm2-11: Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the LORD under Eli the priest. 
#1 Sm2-12: Eli's sons were scoundrels; they had no regard for the LORD. 
#1 Sm2-13: Now it was the practice of the priests that, whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled 
#1 Sm2-14: and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. 
#1 Sm2-15: But even before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw." 
#1 Sm2-16: If the person said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force." 
#1 Sm2-17: This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they "were treating the LORD's offering with contempt. 
#1 Sm2-18: But Samuel was ministering before the LORD —a boy wearing a linen ephod. 
#1 Sm2-19: Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. 
#1 Sm2-20: Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to "the LORD." Then they would go home. 
#1 Sm2-21: And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD. 
#1 Sm2-22: Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
#1 Sm2-23: So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. 
#1 Sm2-24: No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the LORD's people is not good. 
#1 Sm2-25: If one person sins against another, God "may mediate for the offender; but if anyone sins against the LORD, who will intercede for them?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death. 
#1 Sm2-26: And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with people. 
#1 Sm2-27: Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor's family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? 
#1 Sm2-28: I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor's family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites. 
#1 Sm2-29: Why do you "scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?' 
#1 Sm2-30: "Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. 
#1 Sm2-31: The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age, 
#1 Sm2-32: and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age. 
#1 Sm2-33: Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. 
#1 Sm2-34: "'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you —they will both die on the same day. 
#1 Sm2-35: I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before my anointed one always. 
#1 Sm2-36: Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"
 1 SAMUEL 3
#1 Sm3-1: The boy Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli. In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions. 
#1 Sm3-2: One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place. 
#1 Sm3-3: The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the LORD, where the ark of God was. 
#1 Sm3-4: Then the LORD called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am." 
#1 Sm3-5: And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down. 
#1 Sm3-6: Again the LORD called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." 
#1 Sm3-7: Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD: The word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. 
#1 Sm3-8: A third time the LORD called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy. 
#1 Sm3-9: So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
#1 Sm3-10: The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening." 
#1 Sm3-11: And the LORD said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle. 
#1 Sm3-12: At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family —from beginning to end. 
#1 Sm3-13: For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God, "and he failed to restrain them. 
#1 Sm3-14: Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'" 
#1 Sm3-15: Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, 
#1 Sm3-16: but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am." 
#1 Sm3-17: "What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you." 
#1 Sm3-18: So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is the LORD; let him do what is good in his eyes." 
#1 Sm3-19: The LORD was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel's words fall to the ground. 
#1 Sm3-20: And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the LORD. 
#1 Sm3-21: The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.
 1 SAMUEL 4
#1 Sm4-1: And Samuel's word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. 
#1 Sm4-2: The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. 
#1 Sm4-3: When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the LORD bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the LORD's covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies." 
#1 Sm4-4: So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. 
#1 Sm4-5: When the ark of the LORD's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. 
#1 Sm4-6: Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, "What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?" When they learned that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp, 
#1 Sm4-7: the Philistines were afraid. "A god has "come into the camp," they said. "Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before. 
#1 Sm4-8: We're doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
#1 Sm4-9: Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!" 
#1 Sm4-10: So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers. 
#1 Sm4-11: The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died. 
#1 Sm4-12: That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. 
#1 Sm4-13: When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry. 
#1 Sm4-14: Eli heard the outcry and asked, "What is the meaning of this uproar?" The man hurried over to Eli, 
#1 Sm4-15: who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see. 
#1 Sm4-16: He told Eli, "I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day." Eli asked, "What happened, my son?" 
#1 Sm4-17: The man who brought the news replied, "Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured." 
#1 Sm4-18: When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led "Israel forty years. 
#1 Sm4-19: His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains. 
#1 Sm4-20: As she was dying, the women attending her said, "Don't despair; you have given birth to a son." But she did not respond or pay any attention. 
#1 Sm4-21: She named the boy Ichabod, "saying, "The Glory has departed from Israel" —because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. 
#1 Sm4-22: She said, "The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."
 1 SAMUEL 5
#1 Sm5-1: After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
#1 Sm5-2: Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon. 
#1 Sm5-3: When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD! They took Dagon and put him back in his place. 
#1 Sm5-4: But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained. 
#1 Sm5-5: That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold. 
#1 Sm5-6: The LORD's hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors. [^1] 
#1 Sm5-7: When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god." 
#1 Sm5-8: So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, "What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?" They answered, "Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel. 
#1 Sm5-9: But after they had moved it, the LORD's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors. [^2] 
#1 Sm5-10: So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people." 
#1 Sm5-11: So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, "Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it "will kill us and our people." For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy on it. 
#1 Sm5-12: Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
 1 SAMUEL 6
#1 Sm6-1: When the ark of the LORD had been in Philistine territory seven months, 
#1 Sm6-2: the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we should send it back to its place." 
#1 Sm6-3: They answered, "If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you." 
#1 Sm6-4: The Philistines asked, "What guilt offering should we send to him?" They replied, "Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers. 
#1 Sm6-5: Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory to Israel's god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land. 
#1 Sm6-6: Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel's god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way? 
#1 Sm6-7: "Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up. 
#1 Sm6-8: Take the ark of the LORD and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way, 
#1 Sm6-9: but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the LORD has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance." 
#1 Sm6-10: So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves. 
#1 Sm6-11: They placed the ark of the LORD on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors. 
#1 Sm6-12: Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh. 
#1 Sm6-13: Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight. 
#1 Sm6-14: The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. 
#1 Sm6-15: The Levites took down the ark of the LORD, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD. 
#1 Sm6-16: The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron. 
#1 Sm6-17: These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the LORD —one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron. 
#1 Sm6-18: And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers —the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh. 
#1 Sm6-19: But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy "of them to death because they looked into the ark of the LORD. The people mourned because of the heavy blow the LORD had dealt them. 
#1 Sm6-20: And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?" 
#1 Sm6-21: Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to your town."
 1 SAMUEL 7
#1 Sm7-1: So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD. They brought it to Abinadab's house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the LORD. 
#1 Sm7-2: The ark remained at Kiriath Jearim a long time —twenty years in all. Then all the people of Israel turned back to the LORD. 
#1 Sm7-3: So Samuel said to all the Israelites, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the LORD and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines." 
#1 Sm7-4: So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the LORD only. 
#1 Sm7-5: Then Samuel said, "Assemble all Israel at Mizpah, and I will intercede with the LORD for you." 
#1 Sm7-6: When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the LORD. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, "We have sinned against the LORD." Now Samuel was serving as leader "of Israel at Mizpah. 
#1 Sm7-7: When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines. 
#1 Sm7-8: They said to Samuel, "Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines." 
#1 Sm7-9: Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the LORD on Israel's behalf, and the LORD answered him. 
#1 Sm7-10: While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the LORD thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites. 
#1 Sm7-11: The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar. 
#1 Sm7-12: Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, "saying, "Thus far the LORD has helped us." 
#1 Sm7-13: So the Philistines were subdued and they stopped invading Israel's territory. Throughout Samuel's lifetime, the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines. 
#1 Sm7-14: The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
#1 Sm7-15: Samuel continued as Israel's leader all the days of his life. 
#1 Sm7-16: From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places. 
#1 Sm7-17: But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also held court for Israel. And he built an altar there to the LORD.
 1 SAMUEL 8
#1 Sm8-1: When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as Israel's leaders. [^1] 
#1 Sm8-2: The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba. 
#1 Sm8-3: But his sons did not follow his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice. 
#1 Sm8-4: So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. 
#1 Sm8-5: They said to him, "You are old, and your sons do not follow your ways; now appoint a king to lead "us, such as all the other nations have." 
#1 Sm8-6: But when they said, "Give us a king to lead us," this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD. 
#1 Sm8-7: And the LORD told him: "Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. 
#1 Sm8-8: As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. 
#1 Sm8-9: Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights." 
#1 Sm8-10: Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. 
#1 Sm8-11: He said, "This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots. 
#1 Sm8-12: Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. 
#1 Sm8-13: He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. 
#1 Sm8-14: He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants. 
#1 Sm8-15: He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants. 
#1 Sm8-16: Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle "and donkeys he will take for his own use. 
#1 Sm8-17: He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. 
#1 Sm8-18: When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you in that day." 
#1 Sm8-19: But the people refused to listen to Samuel. "No!" they said. "We want a king over us. 
#1 Sm8-20: Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles." 
#1 Sm8-21: When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the LORD. 
#1 Sm8-22: The LORD answered, "Listen to them and give them a king." Then Samuel said to the Israelites, "Everyone go back to your own town."
 1 SAMUEL 9
#1 Sm9-1: There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. 
#1 Sm9-2: Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else. 
#1 Sm9-3: Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys." 
#1 Sm9-4: So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them. 
#1 Sm9-5: When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, "Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us." 
#1 Sm9-6: But the servant replied, "Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take." 
#1 Sm9-7: Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?" 
#1 Sm9-8: The servant answered him again. "Look," he said, "I have a quarter of a shekel "of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take." 
#1 Sm9-9: (Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, "Come, let us go to the seer," because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.) 
#1 Sm9-10: "Good," Saul said to his servant. "Come, let's go." So they set out for the town where the man of God was. 
#1 Sm9-11: As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, "Is the seer here?" 
#1 Sm9-12: "He is," they answered. "He's ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place. 
#1 Sm9-13: As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time." 
#1 Sm9-14: They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place. 
#1 Sm9-15: Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel: 
#1 Sm9-16: "About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me." 
#1 Sm9-17: When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people." 
#1 Sm9-18: Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer's house is?" 
#1 Sm9-19: "I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart. 
#1 Sm9-20: As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?" 
#1 Sm9-21: Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?" 
#1 Sm9-22: Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited —about thirty in number. 
#1 Sm9-23: Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside." 
#1 Sm9-24: So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, 'I have invited guests.'" And Saul dined with Samuel that day. 
#1 Sm9-25: After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house. 
#1 Sm9-26: They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready, and I will send you on your way." When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together. 
#1 Sm9-27: As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us" —and the servant did so —"but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God."
 1 SAMUEL 10
#1 Sm10-1: Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head and kissed him, saying, "Has not the LORD anointed you ruler over his inheritance? [^1] 
#1 Sm10-2: When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, 'The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, "What shall I do about my son?"' 
#1 Sm10-3: "Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine. 
#1 Sm10-4: They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them. 
#1 Sm10-5: "After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying. 
#1 Sm10-6: The Spirit of the LORD will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person. 
#1 Sm10-7: Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you. 
#1 Sm10-8: "Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do." 
#1 Sm10-9: As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul's heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day. 
#1 Sm10-10: When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying. 
#1 Sm10-11: When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, "What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?" 
#1 Sm10-12: A man who lived there answered, "And who is their father?" So it became a saying: "Is Saul also among the prophets?" 
#1 Sm10-13: After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place. 
#1 Sm10-14: Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where have you been?" "Looking for the donkeys," he said. "But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel." 
#1 Sm10-15: Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you." 
#1 Sm10-16: Saul replied, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship. 
#1 Sm10-17: Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the LORD at Mizpah 
#1 Sm10-18: and said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.' 
#1 Sm10-19: But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, 'No, appoint a king over us.' So now present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans." 
#1 Sm10-20: When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. 
#1 Sm10-21: Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri's clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found. 
#1 Sm10-22: So they inquired further of the LORD, "Has the man come here yet?" And the LORD said, "Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies." 
#1 Sm10-23: They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others. 
#1 Sm10-24: Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the man the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." Then the people shouted, "Long live the king!" 
#1 Sm10-25: Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the LORD. Then Samuel dismissed the people to go to their own homes. 
#1 Sm10-26: Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched. 
#1 Sm10-27: But some scoundrels said, "How can this fellow save us?" They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent.
 1 SAMUEL 11
#1 Sm11-1: Nahash "the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, "Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you." 
#1 Sm11-2: But Nahash the Ammonite replied, "I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel." 
#1 Sm11-3: The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you." 
#1 Sm11-4: When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud. 
#1 Sm11-5: Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, "What is wrong with everyone? Why are they weeping?" Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said. 
#1 Sm11-6: When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he burned with anger. 
#1 Sm11-7: He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, "This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel." Then the terror of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out together as one. 
#1 Sm11-8: When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and those of Judah thirty thousand. 
#1 Sm11-9: They told the messengers who had come, "Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, 'By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued.'" When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated. 
#1 Sm11-10: They said to the Ammonites, "Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you like." 
#1 Sm11-11: The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together. 
#1 Sm11-12: The people then said to Samuel, "Who was it that asked, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Turn these men over to us so that we may put them to death." 
#1 Sm11-13: But Saul said, "No one will be put to death today, for this day the LORD has rescued Israel." 
#1 Sm11-14: Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship." 
#1 Sm11-15: So all the people went to Gilgal and made Saul king in the presence of the LORD. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration.
 1 SAMUEL 12
#1 Sm12-1: Samuel said to all Israel, "I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you. 
#1 Sm12-2: Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day. 
#1 Sm12-3: Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the LORD and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these things, I will make it right." 
#1 Sm12-4: "You have not cheated or oppressed us," they replied. "You have not taken anything from anyone's hand." 
#1 Sm12-5: Samuel said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand." "He is witness," they said. 
#1 Sm12-6: Then Samuel said to the people, "It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of Egypt. 
#1 Sm12-7: Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the LORD as to all the righteous acts performed by the LORD for you and your ancestors. 
#1 Sm12-8: "After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the LORD for help, and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place. 
#1 Sm12-9: "But they forgot the LORD their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. 
#1 Sm12-10: They cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned; we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.' 
#1 Sm12-11: Then the LORD sent Jerub-Baal, "Barak, "Jephthah and Samuel, "and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around you, so that you lived in safety. 
#1 Sm12-12: "But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, 'No, we want a king to rule over us' —even though the LORD your God was your king. 
#1 Sm12-13: Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the LORD has set a king over you. 
#1 Sm12-14: If you fear the LORD and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the LORD your God —good! 
#1 Sm12-15: But if you do not obey the LORD, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors. 
#1 Sm12-16: "Now then, stand still and see this great thing the LORD is about to do before your eyes! 
#1 Sm12-17: Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the LORD to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the LORD when you asked for a king." 
#1 Sm12-18: Then Samuel called on the LORD, and that same day the LORD sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the LORD and of Samuel. 
#1 Sm12-19: The people all said to Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king." 
#1 Sm12-20: "Do not be afraid," Samuel replied. "You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart. 
#1 Sm12-21: Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. 
#1 Sm12-22: For the sake of his great name the LORD will not reject his people, because the LORD was pleased to make you his own. 
#1 Sm12-23: As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right. 
#1 Sm12-24: But be sure to fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you. 
#1 Sm12-25: Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish."
 1 SAMUEL 13
#1 Sm13-1: Saul was thirty "years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty- "two years. 
#1 Sm13-2: Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes. 
#1 Sm13-3: Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, "Let the Hebrews hear!" 
#1 Sm13-4: So all Israel heard the news: "Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines." And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal. 
#1 Sm13-5: The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand "chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash, east of Beth Aven. 
#1 Sm13-6: When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns. 
#1 Sm13-7: Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear. 
#1 Sm13-8: He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul's men began to scatter. 
#1 Sm13-9: So he said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings." And Saul offered up the burnt offering. 
#1 Sm13-10: Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. 
#1 Sm13-11: "What have you done?" asked Samuel. Saul replied, "When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, 
#1 Sm13-12: I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering." 
#1 Sm13-13: "You have done a foolish thing," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. 
#1 Sm13-14: But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command." 
#1 Sm13-15: Then Samuel left Gilgal "and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred. 
#1 Sm13-16: Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah "in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Mikmash. 
#1 Sm13-17: Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual, 
#1 Sm13-18: another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness. 
#1 Sm13-19: Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!" 
#1 Sm13-20: So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles "sharpened. 
#1 Sm13-21: The price was two-thirds of a shekel "for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel "for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads. 
#1 Sm13-22: So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them. 
#1 Sm13-23: Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash.
 1 SAMUEL 14
#1 Sm14-1: One day Jonathan son of Saul said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side." But he did not tell his father. 
#1 Sm14-2: Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men, 
#1 Sm14-3: among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left. 
#1 Sm14-4: On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. 
#1 Sm14-5: One cliff stood to the north toward Mikmash, the other to the south toward Geba. 
#1 Sm14-6: Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few." 
#1 Sm14-7: "Do all that you have in mind," his armor-bearer said. "Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul." 
#1 Sm14-8: Jonathan said, "Come on, then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us. 
#1 Sm14-9: If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them. 
#1 Sm14-10: But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the LORD has given them into our hands." 
#1 Sm14-11: So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in." 
#1 Sm14-12: The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson." So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel." 
#1 Sm14-13: Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him. 
#1 Sm14-14: In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre. 
#1 Sm14-15: Then panic struck the whole army —those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties —and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God. [^1] 
#1 Sm14-16: Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions. 
#1 Sm14-17: Then Saul said to the men who were with him, "Muster the forces and see who has left us." When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there. 
#1 Sm14-18: Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God." (At that time it was with the Israelites.) [^2] 
#1 Sm14-19: While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand." 
#1 Sm14-20: Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords. 
#1 Sm14-21: Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
#1 Sm14-22: When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit. 
#1 Sm14-23: So on that day the LORD saved Israel, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven. 
#1 Sm14-24: Now the Israelites were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, "Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the troops tasted food. 
#1 Sm14-25: The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground. 
#1 Sm14-26: When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out; yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. 
#1 Sm14-27: But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened. [^3] 
#1 Sm14-28: Then one of the soldiers told him, "Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be anyone who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint." 
#1 Sm14-29: Jonathan said, "My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey. 
#1 Sm14-30: How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?" 
#1 Sm14-31: That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Mikmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted. 
#1 Sm14-32: They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood. 
#1 Sm14-33: Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in it." "You have broken faith," he said. "Roll a large stone over here at once." 
#1 Sm14-34: Then he said, "Go out among the men and tell them, 'Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood still in it.'" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there. 
#1 Sm14-35: Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had done this. 
#1 Sm14-36: Saul said, "Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive." "Do whatever seems best to you," they replied. But the priest said, "Let us inquire of God here." 
#1 Sm14-37: So Saul asked God, "Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?" But God did not answer him that day. 
#1 Sm14-38: Saul therefore said, "Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today. 
#1 Sm14-39: As surely as the LORD who rescues Israel lives, even if the guilt lies with my son Jonathan, he must die." But not one of them said a word. 
#1 Sm14-40: Saul then said to all the Israelites, "You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here." "Do what seems best to you," they replied. 
#1 Sm14-41: Then Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Why have you not answered your servant today? If the fault is in me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the men of Israel are at fault, "respond with Thummim." Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared. 
#1 Sm14-42: Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken. 
#1 Sm14-43: Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now I must die!" 
#1 Sm14-44: Saul said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan." 
#1 Sm14-45: But the men said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die —he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help." So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death. 
#1 Sm14-46: Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land. 
#1 Sm14-47: After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings "of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them. [^6] 
#1 Sm14-48: He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them. 
#1 Sm14-49: Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal. 
#1 Sm14-50: His wife's name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul's army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul's uncle. 
#1 Sm14-51: Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel. 
#1 Sm14-52: All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.
 1 SAMUEL 15
#1 Sm15-1: Samuel said to Saul, "I am the one the LORD sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the LORD. 
#1 Sm15-2: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. 
#1 Sm15-3: Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy "all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'" 
#1 Sm15-4: So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim —two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. 
#1 Sm15-5: Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. 
#1 Sm15-6: Then he said to the Kenites, "Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites. 
#1 Sm15-7: Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt. 
#1 Sm15-8: He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. 
#1 Sm15-9: But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves "and lambs —everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed. 
#1 Sm15-10: Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel: 
#1 Sm15-11: "I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions." Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the LORD all that night. 
#1 Sm15-12: Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, "Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal." 
#1 Sm15-13: When Samuel reached him, Saul said, "The LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD's instructions." 
#1 Sm15-14: But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?" 
#1 Sm15-15: Saul answered, "The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we totally destroyed the rest." 
#1 Sm15-16: "Enough!" Samuel said to Saul. "Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." "Tell me," Saul replied. 
#1 Sm15-17: Samuel said, "Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel. 
#1 Sm15-18: And he sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.' 
#1 Sm15-19: Why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?" 
#1 Sm15-20: "But I did obey the LORD," Saul said. "I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. 
#1 Sm15-21: The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal." 
#1 Sm15-22: But Samuel replied: "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. 
#1 Sm15-23: For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king." 
#1 Sm15-24: Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned. I violated the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. 
#1 Sm15-25: Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD." 
#1 Sm15-26: But Samuel said to him, "I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!" 
#1 Sm15-27: As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. 
#1 Sm15-28: Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors —to one better than you. 
#1 Sm15-29: He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind." 
#1 Sm15-30: Saul replied, "I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God." 
#1 Sm15-31: So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD. 
#1 Sm15-32: Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites." Agag came to him in chains. "And he thought, "Surely the bitterness of death is past." 
#1 Sm15-33: But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women." And Samuel put Agag to death before the LORD at Gilgal. 
#1 Sm15-34: Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. 
#1 Sm15-35: Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
 1 SAMUEL 16
#1 Sm16-1: The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king." 
#1 Sm16-2: But Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me." The LORD said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.' 
#1 Sm16-3: Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate." 
#1 Sm16-4: Samuel did what the LORD said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, "Do you come in peace?" 
#1 Sm16-5: Samuel replied, "Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me." Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 
#1 Sm16-6: When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed stands here before the LORD." 
#1 Sm16-7: But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." 
#1 Sm16-8: Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either." 
#1 Sm16-9: Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, "Nor has the LORD chosen this one." 
#1 Sm16-10: Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, "The LORD has not chosen these." 
#1 Sm16-11: So he asked Jesse, "Are these all the sons you have?" "There is still the youngest," Jesse answered. "He is tending the sheep." Samuel said, "Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives." 
#1 Sm16-12: So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the LORD said, "Rise and anoint him; this is the one." 
#1 Sm16-13: So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah. 
#1 Sm16-14: Now the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil "spirit from the LORD tormented him. 
#1 Sm16-15: Saul's attendants said to him, "See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
#1 Sm16-16: Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will feel better." 
#1 Sm16-17: So Saul said to his attendants, "Find someone who plays well and bring him to me." 
#1 Sm16-18: One of the servants answered, "I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the LORD is with him." 
#1 Sm16-19: Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep." 
#1 Sm16-20: So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul. 
#1 Sm16-21: David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers. 
#1 Sm16-22: Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, "Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him." 
#1 Sm16-23: Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.
 1 SAMUEL 17
#1 Sm17-1: Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Sokoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokoh and Azekah. 
#1 Sm17-2: Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. 
#1 Sm17-3: The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. 
#1 Sm17-4: A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span. [^1] 
#1 Sm17-5: He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels "; 
#1 Sm17-6: on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. 
#1 Sm17-7: His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. "His shield bearer went ahead of him. 
#1 Sm17-8: Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. 
#1 Sm17-9: If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us." 
#1 Sm17-10: Then the Philistine said, "This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other." 
#1 Sm17-11: On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified. 
#1 Sm17-12: Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was very old. 
#1 Sm17-13: Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. 
#1 Sm17-14: David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, 
#1 Sm17-15: but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem. 
#1 Sm17-16: For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand. 
#1 Sm17-17: Now Jesse said to his son David, "Take this ephah "of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. 
#1 Sm17-18: Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance "from them. 
#1 Sm17-19: They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines." 
#1 Sm17-20: Early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. 
#1 Sm17-21: Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. 
#1 Sm17-22: David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were. 
#1 Sm17-23: As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. 
#1 Sm17-24: Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear. 
#1 Sm17-25: Now the Israelites had been saying, "Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel." 
#1 Sm17-26: David asked the men standing near him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?" 
#1 Sm17-27: They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, "This is what will be done for the man who kills him." 
#1 Sm17-28: When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, "Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle." 
#1 Sm17-29: "Now what have I done?" said David. "Can't I even speak?" 
#1 Sm17-30: He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. 
#1 Sm17-31: What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him. 
#1 Sm17-32: David said to Saul, "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him." 
#1 Sm17-33: Saul replied, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth." 
#1 Sm17-34: But David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, 
#1 Sm17-35: I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. 
#1 Sm17-36: Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. 
#1 Sm17-37: The LORD who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you." 
#1 Sm17-38: Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. 
#1 Sm17-39: David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul, "because I am not used to them." So he took them off. 
#1 Sm17-40: Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine. 
#1 Sm17-41: Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. 
#1 Sm17-42: He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him. 
#1 Sm17-43: He said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
#1 Sm17-44: "Come here," he said, "and I'll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!" 
#1 Sm17-45: David said to the Philistine, "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 
#1 Sm17-46: This day the LORD will deliver you into my hands, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. 
#1 Sm17-47: All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands." 
#1 Sm17-48: As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. 
#1 Sm17-49: Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. 
#1 Sm17-50: So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. 
#1 Sm17-51: David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. 
#1 Sm17-52: Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath "and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. 
#1 Sm17-53: When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp. 
#1 Sm17-54: David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem; he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent. 
#1 Sm17-55: As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is that young man?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don't know." 
#1 Sm17-56: The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is." 
#1 Sm17-57: As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head. 
#1 Sm17-58: "Whose son are you, young man?" Saul asked him. David said, "I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem."
 1 SAMUEL 18
#1 Sm18-1: After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. 
#1 Sm18-2: From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family. 
#1 Sm18-3: And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. 
#1 Sm18-4: Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt. 
#1 Sm18-5: Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the troops, and Saul's officers as well. 
#1 Sm18-6: When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with timbrels and lyres. 
#1 Sm18-7: As they danced, they sang: "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands." 
#1 Sm18-8: Saul was very angry; this refrain displeased him greatly. "They have credited David with tens of thousands," he thought, "but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?" 
#1 Sm18-9: And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on David. 
#1 Sm18-10: The next day an evil "spirit from God came forcefully on Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand 
#1 Sm18-11: and he hurled it, saying to himself, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David eluded him twice. 
#1 Sm18-12: Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had departed from Saul. 
#1 Sm18-13: So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns. 
#1 Sm18-14: In everything he did he had great success, because the LORD was with him. 
#1 Sm18-15: When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him. 
#1 Sm18-16: But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns. 
#1 Sm18-17: Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD." For Saul said to himself, "I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!" 
#1 Sm18-18: But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?" 
#1 Sm18-19: So "when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah. 
#1 Sm18-20: Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased. 
#1 Sm18-21: "I will give her to him," he thought, "so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law." 
#1 Sm18-22: Then Saul ordered his attendants: "Speak to David privately and say, 'Look, the king likes you, and his attendants all love you; now become his son-in-law.'" 
#1 Sm18-23: They repeated these words to David. But David said, "Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known." 
#1 Sm18-24: When Saul's servants told him what David had said, 
#1 Sm18-25: Saul replied, "Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines. 
#1 Sm18-26: When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, 
#1 Sm18-27: David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage. 
#1 Sm18-28: When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David, 
#1 Sm18-29: Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days. 
#1 Sm18-30: The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.
 1 SAMUEL 19
#1 Sm19-1: Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David 
#1 Sm19-2: and warned him, "My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there. 
#1 Sm19-3: I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I'll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out." 
#1 Sm19-4: Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly. 
#1 Sm19-5: He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?" 
#1 Sm19-6: Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death." 
#1 Sm19-7: So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before. 
#1 Sm19-8: Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him. 
#1 Sm19-9: But an evil "spirit from the LORD came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the lyre, 
#1 Sm19-10: Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape. 
#1 Sm19-11: Saul sent men to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't run for your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed." 
#1 Sm19-12: So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped. 
#1 Sm19-13: Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head. 
#1 Sm19-14: When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, "He is ill." 
#1 Sm19-15: Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, "Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him." 
#1 Sm19-16: But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats' hair. 
#1 Sm19-17: Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?" Michal told him, "He said to me, 'Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'" 
#1 Sm19-18: When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. 
#1 Sm19-19: Word came to Saul: "David is in Naioth at Ramah"; 
#1 Sm19-20: so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on Saul's men, and they also prophesied. 
#1 Sm19-21: Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied. 
#1 Sm19-22: Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" "Over in Naioth at Ramah," they said. 
#1 Sm19-23: So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even on him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth. 
#1 Sm19-24: He stripped off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
 1 SAMUEL 20
#1 Sm20-1: Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?" 
#1 Sm20-2: "Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn't so!" 
#1 Sm20-3: But David took an oath and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death." 
#1 Sm20-4: Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you." 
#1 Sm20-5: So David said, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon feast, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow. 
#1 Sm20-6: If your father misses me at all, tell him, 'David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.' 
#1 Sm20-7: If he says, 'Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me. 
#1 Sm20-8: As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?" 
#1 Sm20-9: "Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?" 
#1 Sm20-10: David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?" 
#1 Sm20-11: "Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together. 
#1 Sm20-12: Then Jonathan said to David, "I swear by the LORD, the God of Israel, that I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know? 
#1 Sm20-13: But if my father intends to harm you, may the LORD deal with Jonathan, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away in peace. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father. 
#1 Sm20-14: But show me unfailing kindness like the LORD's kindness as long as I live, so that I may not be killed, 
#1 Sm20-15: and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family —not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth." 
#1 Sm20-16: So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD call David's enemies to account." 
#1 Sm20-17: And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself. 
#1 Sm20-18: Then Jonathan said to David, "Tomorrow is the New Moon feast. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 
#1 Sm20-19: The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel. 
#1 Sm20-20: I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. 
#1 Sm20-21: Then I will send a boy and say, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger. 
#1 Sm20-22: But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away. 
#1 Sm20-23: And about the matter you and I discussed —remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever." 
#1 Sm20-24: So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon feast came, the king sat down to eat. 
#1 Sm20-25: He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, "and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty. 
#1 Sm20-26: Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, "Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean —surely he is unclean." 
#1 Sm20-27: But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?" 
#1 Sm20-28: Jonathan answered, "David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. 
#1 Sm20-29: He said, 'Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table." 
#1 Sm20-30: Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you? 
#1 Sm20-31: As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die!" 
#1 Sm20-32: "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" Jonathan asked his father. 
#1 Sm20-33: But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David. 
#1 Sm20-34: Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the feast he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David. 
#1 Sm20-35: In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him, 
#1 Sm20-36: and he said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
#1 Sm20-37: When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?" 
#1 Sm20-38: Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. 
#1 Sm20-39: (The boy knew nothing about all this; only Jonathan and David knew.) 
#1 Sm20-40: Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, "Go, carry them back to town." 
#1 Sm20-41: After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together —but David wept the most. 
#1 Sm20-42: Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town. [^2]
 1 SAMUEL 21
#1 Sm21-1: David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?" 
#1 Sm21-2: David answered Ahimelek the priest, "The king sent me on a mission and said to me, 'No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.' As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 
#1 Sm21-3: Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find." 
#1 Sm21-4: But the priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here —provided the men have kept themselves from women." 
#1 Sm21-5: David replied, "Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever "I set out. The men's bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!" 
#1 Sm21-6: So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away. 
#1 Sm21-7: Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul's chief shepherd. 
#1 Sm21-8: David asked Ahimelek, "Don't you have a spear or a sword here? I haven't brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king's mission was urgent." 
#1 Sm21-9: The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me." 
#1 Sm21-10: That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. 
#1 Sm21-11: But the servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one they sing about in their dances: "'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?" 
#1 Sm21-12: David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. 
#1 Sm21-13: So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard. 
#1 Sm21-14: Achish said to his servants, "Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? 
#1 Sm21-15: Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?"
 1 SAMUEL 22
#1 Sm22-1: David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's household heard about it, they went down to him there. 
#1 Sm22-2: All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their commander. About four hundred men were with him. 
#1 Sm22-3: From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?" 
#1 Sm22-4: So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold. 
#1 Sm22-5: But the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth. 
#1 Sm22-6: Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul was seated, spear in hand, under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing at his side. 
#1 Sm22-7: He said to them, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 
#1 Sm22-8: Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today." 
#1 Sm22-9: But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul's officials, said, "I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob. 
#1 Sm22-10: Ahimelek inquired of the LORD for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine." 
#1 Sm22-11: Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king. 
#1 Sm22-12: Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." "Yes, my lord," he answered. 
#1 Sm22-13: Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?" 
#1 Sm22-14: Ahimelek answered the king, "Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household? 
#1 Sm22-15: Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father's family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair." 
#1 Sm22-16: But the king said, "You will surely die, Ahimelek, you and your whole family." 
#1 Sm22-17: Then the king ordered the guards at his side: "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me." But the king's officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the LORD. 
#1 Sm22-18: The king then ordered Doeg, "You turn and strike down the priests." So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. 
#1 Sm22-19: He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep. 
#1 Sm22-20: But one son of Ahimelek son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to join David. 
#1 Sm22-21: He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD. 
#1 Sm22-22: Then David said to Abiathar, "That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your whole family. 
#1 Sm22-23: Stay with me; don't be afraid. The man who wants to kill you is trying to kill me too. You will be safe with me."
 1 SAMUEL 23
#1 Sm23-1: When David was told, "Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors," 
#1 Sm23-2: he inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" The LORD answered him, "Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah." 
#1 Sm23-3: But David's men said to him, "Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!" 
#1 Sm23-4: Once again David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him, "Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand." 
#1 Sm23-5: So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah. 
#1 Sm23-6: (Now Abiathar son of Ahimelek had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.) 
#1 Sm23-7: Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, "God has delivered him into my hands, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars." 
#1 Sm23-8: And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men. 
#1 Sm23-9: When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod." 
#1 Sm23-10: David said, "LORD, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me. 
#1 Sm23-11: Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? LORD, God of Israel, tell your servant." And the LORD said, "He will." 
#1 Sm23-12: Again David asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will." 
#1 Sm23-13: So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there. 
#1 Sm23-14: David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands. 
#1 Sm23-15: While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that "Saul had come out to take his life. 
#1 Sm23-16: And Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God. 
#1 Sm23-17: "Don't be afraid," he said. "My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this." 
#1 Sm23-18: The two of them made a covenant before the LORD. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh. 
#1 Sm23-19: The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon? 
#1 Sm23-20: Now, Your Majesty, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for giving him into your hands." 
#1 Sm23-21: Saul replied, "The LORD bless you for your concern for me. 
#1 Sm23-22: Go and get more information. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty. 
#1 Sm23-23: Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah." 
#1 Sm23-24: So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. 
#1 Sm23-25: Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David. 
#1 Sm23-26: Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them, 
#1 Sm23-27: a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land." 
#1 Sm23-28: Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth. [^2] 
#1 Sm23-29: And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi. [^3]
 1 SAMUEL 24
#1 Sm24-1: After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, "David is in the Desert of En Gedi." 
#1 Sm24-2: So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats. 
#1 Sm24-3: He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. 
#1 Sm24-4: The men said, "This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said "to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe. 
#1 Sm24-5: Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. 
#1 Sm24-6: He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the LORD." 
#1 Sm24-7: With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way. 
#1 Sm24-8: Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. 
#1 Sm24-9: He said to Saul, "Why do you listen when men say, 'David is bent on harming you'? 
#1 Sm24-10: This day you have seen with your own eyes how the LORD delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, 'I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the LORD's anointed.' 
#1 Sm24-11: See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. 
#1 Sm24-12: May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. 
#1 Sm24-13: As the old saying goes, 'From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you. 
#1 Sm24-14: "Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? 
#1 Sm24-15: May the LORD be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand." 
#1 Sm24-16: When David finished saying this, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, David my son?" And he wept aloud. 
#1 Sm24-17: "You are more righteous than I," he said. "You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. 
#1 Sm24-18: You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. 
#1 Sm24-19: When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you well for the way you treated me today. 
#1 Sm24-20: I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. 
#1 Sm24-21: Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family." 
#1 Sm24-22: So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
 1 SAMUEL 25
#1 Sm25-1: Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Paran. [^1] 
#1 Sm25-2: A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. 
#1 Sm25-3: His name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings —he was a Calebite. 
#1 Sm25-4: While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. 
#1 Sm25-5: So he sent ten young men and said to them, "Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name. 
#1 Sm25-6: Say to him: 'Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours! 
#1 Sm25-7: "'Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. 
#1 Sm25-8: Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.'" 
#1 Sm25-9: When David's men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David's name. Then they waited. 
#1 Sm25-10: Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days. 
#1 Sm25-11: Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?" 
#1 Sm25-12: David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word. 
#1 Sm25-13: David said to his men, "Each of you strap on your sword!" So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies. 
#1 Sm25-14: One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal's wife, "David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them. 
#1 Sm25-15: Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing. 
#1 Sm25-16: Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them. 
#1 Sm25-17: Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him." 
#1 Sm25-18: Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs "of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys. 
#1 Sm25-19: Then she told her servants, "Go on ahead; I'll follow you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 
#1 Sm25-20: As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them. 
#1 Sm25-21: David had just said, "It's been useless —all my watching over this fellow's property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good. 
#1 Sm25-22: May God deal with David, "be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!" 
#1 Sm25-23: When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground. 
#1 Sm25-24: She fell at his feet and said: "Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you; hear what your servant has to say. 
#1 Sm25-25: Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name —his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent. 
#1 Sm25-26: And now, my lord, as surely as the LORD your God lives and as you live, since the LORD has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Nabal. 
#1 Sm25-27: And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you. 
#1 Sm25-28: "Please forgive your servant's presumption. The LORD your God will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the LORD's battles, and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live. 
#1 Sm25-29: Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling. 
#1 Sm25-30: When the LORD has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel, 
#1 Sm25-31: my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the LORD your God has brought my lord success, remember your servant." 
#1 Sm25-32: David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me. 
#1 Sm25-33: May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands. 
#1 Sm25-34: Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak." 
#1 Sm25-35: Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, "Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request." 
#1 Sm25-36: When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak. 
#1 Sm25-37: Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone. 
#1 Sm25-38: About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died. 
#1 Sm25-39: When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head." Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife. 
#1 Sm25-40: His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, "David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife." 
#1 Sm25-41: She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, "I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord's servants." 
#1 Sm25-42: Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five female servants, went with David's messengers and became his wife. 
#1 Sm25-43: David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives. 
#1 Sm25-44: But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel "son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
 1 SAMUEL 26
#1 Sm26-1: The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?" 
#1 Sm26-2: So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand select Israelite troops, to search there for David. 
#1 Sm26-3: Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had followed him there, 
#1 Sm26-4: he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived. 
#1 Sm26-5: Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him. 
#1 Sm26-6: David then asked Ahimelek the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?" "I'll go with you," said Abishai. 
#1 Sm26-7: So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him. 
#1 Sm26-8: Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won't strike him twice." 
#1 Sm26-9: But David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the LORD's anointed and be guiltless? 
#1 Sm26-10: As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "the LORD himself will strike him, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. 
#1 Sm26-11: But the LORD forbid that I should lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let's go." 
#1 Sm26-12: So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the LORD had put them into a deep sleep. 
#1 Sm26-13: Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them. 
#1 Sm26-14: He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, "Aren't you going to answer me, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you who calls to the king?" 
#1 Sm26-15: David said, "You're a man, aren't you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king. 
#1 Sm26-16: What you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, you and your men must die, because you did not guard your master, the LORD's anointed. Look around you. Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?" 
#1 Sm26-17: Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is that your voice, David my son?" David replied, "Yes it is, my lord the king." 
#1 Sm26-18: And he added, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of? 
#1 Sm26-19: Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, people have done it, may they be cursed before the LORD! They have driven me today from my share in the LORD's inheritance and have said, 'Go, serve other gods.' 
#1 Sm26-20: Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea —as one hunts a partridge in the mountains." 
#1 Sm26-21: Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have been terribly wrong." 
#1 Sm26-22: "Here is the king's spear," David answered. "Let one of your young men come over and get it. 
#1 Sm26-23: The LORD rewards everyone for their righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. 
#1 Sm26-24: As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all trouble." 
#1 Sm26-25: Then Saul said to David, "May you be blessed, David my son; you will do great things and surely triumph." So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
 1 SAMUEL 27
#1 Sm27-1: But David thought to himself, "One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand." 
#1 Sm27-2: So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maok king of Gath. 
#1 Sm27-3: David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. 
#1 Sm27-4: When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him. 
#1 Sm27-5: Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?" 
#1 Sm27-6: So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. 
#1 Sm27-7: David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months. 
#1 Sm27-8: Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.) 
#1 Sm27-9: Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish. 
#1 Sm27-10: When Achish asked, "Where did you go raiding today?" David would say, "Against the Negev of Judah" or "Against the Negev of Jerahmeel" or "Against the Negev of the Kenites." 
#1 Sm27-11: He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, "They might inform on us and say, 'This is what David did.'" And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory. 
#1 Sm27-12: Achish trusted David and said to himself, "He has become so obnoxious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant for life."
 1 SAMUEL 28
#1 Sm28-1: In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, "You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army." 
#1 Sm28-2: David said, "Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do." Achish replied, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life." 
#1 Sm28-3: Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land. 
#1 Sm28-4: The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa. 
#1 Sm28-5: When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. 
#1 Sm28-6: He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. 
#1 Sm28-7: Saul then said to his attendants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her." "There is one in Endor," they said. 
#1 Sm28-8: So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. "Consult a spirit for me," he said, "and bring up for me the one I name." 
#1 Sm28-9: But the woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?" 
#1 Sm28-10: Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As surely as the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this." 
#1 Sm28-11: Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" "Bring up Samuel," he said. 
#1 Sm28-12: When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!" 
#1 Sm28-13: The king said to her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" The woman said, "I see a ghostly figure "coming up out of the earth." 
#1 Sm28-14: "What does he look like?" he asked. "An old man wearing a robe is coming up," she said. Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. 
#1 Sm28-15: Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" "I am in great distress," Saul said. "The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do." 
#1 Sm28-16: Samuel said, "Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has departed from you and become your enemy? 
#1 Sm28-17: The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors —to David. 
#1 Sm28-18: Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today. 
#1 Sm28-19: The LORD will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines." 
#1 Sm28-20: Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel's words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night. 
#1 Sm28-21: When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, "Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. 
#1 Sm28-22: Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way." 
#1 Sm28-23: He refused and said, "I will not eat." But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch. 
#1 Sm28-24: The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. 
#1 Sm28-25: Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.
 1 SAMUEL 29
#1 Sm29-1: The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel. 
#1 Sm29-2: As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish. 
#1 Sm29-3: The commanders of the Philistines asked, "What about these Hebrews?" Achish replied, "Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him." 
#1 Sm29-4: But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master's favor than by taking the heads of our own men? 
#1 Sm29-5: Isn't this the David they sang about in their dances: "'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?" 
#1 Sm29-6: So Achish called David and said to him, "As surely as the LORD lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until today, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don't approve of you. 
#1 Sm29-7: Now turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers." 
#1 Sm29-8: "But what have I done?" asked David. "What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can't I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?" 
#1 Sm29-9: Achish answered, "I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, 'He must not go up with us into battle.' 
#1 Sm29-10: Now get up early, along with your master's servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light." 
#1 Sm29-11: So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
 1 SAMUEL 30
#1 Sm30-1: David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it, 
#1 Sm30-2: and had taken captive the women and everyone else in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way. 
#1 Sm30-3: When David and his men reached Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. 
#1 Sm30-4: So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep. 
#1 Sm30-5: David's two wives had been captured —Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. 
#1 Sm30-6: David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God. 
#1 Sm30-7: Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelek, "Bring me the ephod." Abiathar brought it to him, 
#1 Sm30-8: and David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?" "Pursue them," he answered. "You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue." 
#1 Sm30-9: David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind. 
#1 Sm30-10: Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley, but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit. 
#1 Sm30-11: They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat — 
#1 Sm30-12: part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights. 
#1 Sm30-13: David asked him, "Who do you belong to? Where do you come from?" He said, "I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago. 
#1 Sm30-14: We raided the Negev of the Kerethites, some territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag." 
#1 Sm30-15: David asked him, "Can you lead me down to this raiding party?" He answered, "Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them." 
#1 Sm30-16: He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah. 
#1 Sm30-17: David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled. 
#1 Sm30-18: David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. 
#1 Sm30-19: Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back. 
#1 Sm30-20: He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, "This is David's plunder." 
#1 Sm30-21: Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Valley. They came out to meet David and the men with him. As David and his men approached, he asked them how they were. 
#1 Sm30-22: But all the evil men and troublemakers among David's followers said, "Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go." 
#1 Sm30-23: David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us. 
#1 Sm30-24: Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike." 
#1 Sm30-25: David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this. 
#1 Sm30-26: When David reached Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, "Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD's enemies." 
#1 Sm30-27: David sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir; 
#1 Sm30-28: to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa 
#1 Sm30-29: and Rakal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites; 
#1 Sm30-30: to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athak 
#1 Sm30-31: and Hebron; and to those in all the other places where he and his men had roamed.
 1 SAMUEL 31
#1 Sm31-1: Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa. 
#1 Sm31-2: The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua. 
#1 Sm31-3: The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically. 
#1 Sm31-4: Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it. 
#1 Sm31-5: When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him. 
#1 Sm31-6: So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day. 
#1 Sm31-7: When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them. 
#1 Sm31-8: The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
#1 Sm31-9: They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people. 
#1 Sm31-10: They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan. 
#1 Sm31-11: When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
#1 Sm31-12: all their valiant men marched through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them. 
#1 Sm31-13: Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.
2 SAMUEL
 2 SAMUEL 1
#2 Sm1-1: After the death of Saul, David returned from striking down the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. 
#2 Sm1-2: On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor. 
#2 Sm1-3: "Where have you come from?" David asked him. He answered, "I have escaped from the Israelite camp." 
#2 Sm1-4: "What happened?" David asked. "Tell me." "The men fled from the battle," he replied. "Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead." 
#2 Sm1-5: Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?" 
#2 Sm1-6: "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa," the young man said, "and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and their drivers in hot pursuit. 
#2 Sm1-7: When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, 'What can I do?' 
#2 Sm1-8: "He asked me, 'Who are you?' "'An Amalekite,' I answered. 
#2 Sm1-9: "Then he said to me, 'Stand here by me and kill me! I'm in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.' 
#2 Sm1-10: "So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord." 
#2 Sm1-11: Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. 
#2 Sm1-12: They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and for the nation of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. 
#2 Sm1-13: David said to the young man who brought him the report, "Where are you from?" "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite," he answered. 
#2 Sm1-14: David asked him, "Why weren't you afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?" 
#2 Sm1-15: Then David called one of his men and said, "Go, strike him down!" So he struck him down, and he died. 
#2 Sm1-16: For David had said to him, "Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'" 
#2 Sm1-17: David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, 
#2 Sm1-18: and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar): 
#2 Sm1-19: "A gazelle "lies slain on your heights, Israel. How the mighty have fallen! 
#2 Sm1-20: "Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. 
#2 Sm1-21: "Mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, may no showers fall on your terraced fields. "For there the shield of the mighty was despised, the shield of Saul —no longer rubbed with oil. 
#2 Sm1-22: "From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. 
#2 Sm1-23: Saul and Jonathan — in life they were loved and admired, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. 
#2 Sm1-24: "Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. 
#2 Sm1-25: "How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. 
#2 Sm1-26: I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women. 
#2 Sm1-27: "How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!"
 2 SAMUEL 2
#2 Sm2-1: In the course of time, David inquired of the LORD. "Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?" he asked. The LORD said, "Go up." David asked, "Where shall I go?" "To Hebron," the LORD answered. 
#2 Sm2-2: So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel. 
#2 Sm2-3: David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns. 
#2 Sm2-4: Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah. When David was told that it was the men from Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul, 
#2 Sm2-5: he sent messengers to them to say to them, "The LORD bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him. 
#2 Sm2-6: May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this. 
#2 Sm2-7: Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the people of Judah have anointed me king over them." 
#2 Sm2-8: Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. 
#2 Sm2-9: He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel. 
#2 Sm2-10: Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The tribe of Judah, however, remained loyal to David. 
#2 Sm2-11: The length of time David was king in Hebron over Judah was seven years and six months. 
#2 Sm2-12: Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon. 
#2 Sm2-13: Joab son of Zeruiah and David's men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side. 
#2 Sm2-14: Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us." "All right, let them do it," Joab said. 
#2 Sm2-15: So they stood up and were counted off —twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David. 
#2 Sm2-16: Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent's side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim. [^1] 
#2 Sm2-17: The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David's men. 
#2 Sm2-18: The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle. 
#2 Sm2-19: He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him. 
#2 Sm2-20: Abner looked behind him and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" "It is," he answered. 
#2 Sm2-21: Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel would not stop chasing him. 
#2 Sm2-22: Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?" 
#2 Sm2-23: But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died. 
#2 Sm2-24: But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon. 
#2 Sm2-25: Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill. 
#2 Sm2-26: Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their fellow Israelites?" 
#2 Sm2-27: Joab answered, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued pursuing them until morning." 
#2 Sm2-28: So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the troops came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore. 
#2 Sm2-29: All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the morning hours "and came to Mahanaim. 
#2 Sm2-30: Then Joab stopped pursuing Abner and assembled the whole army. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were found missing. 
#2 Sm2-31: But David's men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner. 
#2 Sm2-32: They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
 2 SAMUEL 3
#2 Sm3-1: The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. 
#2 Sm3-2: Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel; 
#2 Sm3-3: his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maakah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 
#2 Sm3-4: the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 
#2 Sm3-5: and the sixth, Ithream the son of David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron. 
#2 Sm3-6: During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul. 
#2 Sm3-7: Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?" 
#2 Sm3-8: Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said. So he answered, "Am I a dog's head —on Judah's side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven't handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman! 
#2 Sm3-9: May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on oath 
#2 Sm3-10: and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba." 
#2 Sm3-11: Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him. 
#2 Sm3-12: Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, "Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you." 
#2 Sm3-13: "Good," said David. "I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me." 
#2 Sm3-14: Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins." 
#2 Sm3-15: So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. 
#2 Sm3-16: Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go back home!" So he went back. 
#2 Sm3-17: Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, "For some time you have wanted to make David your king. 
#2 Sm3-18: Now do it! For the LORD promised David, 'By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'" 
#2 Sm3-19: Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole tribe of Benjamin wanted to do. 
#2 Sm3-20: When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men. 
#2 Sm3-21: Then Abner said to David, "Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace. 
#2 Sm3-22: Just then David's men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. 
#2 Sm3-23: When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace. 
#2 Sm3-24: So Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone! 
#2 Sm3-25: You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing." 
#2 Sm3-26: Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern at Sirah. But David did not know it. 
#2 Sm3-27: Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into an inner chamber, as if to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died. 
#2 Sm3-28: Later, when David heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner. 
#2 Sm3-29: May his blood fall on the head of Joab and on his whole family! May Joab's family never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy "or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food." 
#2 Sm3-30: (Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.) 
#2 Sm3-31: Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner." King David himself walked behind the bier. 
#2 Sm3-32: They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people wept also. 
#2 Sm3-33: The king sang this lament for Abner: "Should Abner have died as the lawless die? 
#2 Sm3-34: Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before the wicked." And all the people wept over him again. 
#2 Sm3-35: Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!" 
#2 Sm3-36: All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them. 
#2 Sm3-37: So on that day all the people there and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner. 
#2 Sm3-38: Then the king said to his men, "Do you not realize that a commander and a great man has fallen in Israel this day? 
#2 Sm3-39: And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!"
 2 SAMUEL 4
#2 Sm4-1: When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed. 
#2 Sm4-2: Now Saul's son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Rekab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin —Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin, 
#2 Sm4-3: because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have resided there as foreigners to this day. 
#2 Sm4-4: (Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.) 
#2 Sm4-5: Now Rekab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest. 
#2 Sm4-6: They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rekab and his brother Baanah slipped away. 
#2 Sm4-7: They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head. Taking it with them, they traveled all night by way of the Arabah. 
#2 Sm4-8: They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to kill you. This day the LORD has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring." 
#2 Sm4-9: David answered Rekab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble, 
#2 Sm4-10: when someone told me, 'Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news! 
#2 Sm4-11: How much more —when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed —should I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!" 
#2 Sm4-12: So David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner's tomb at Hebron.
 2 SAMUEL 5
#2 Sm5-1: All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "We are your own flesh and blood. 
#2 Sm5-2: In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'" 
#2 Sm5-3: When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel. 
#2 Sm5-4: David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. 
#2 Sm5-5: In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years. 
#2 Sm5-6: The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, "You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off." They thought, "David cannot get in here." 
#2 Sm5-7: Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion —which is the City of David. 
#2 Sm5-8: On that day David had said, "Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those 'lame and blind' who are David's enemies. "" That is why they say, "The 'blind and lame' will not enter the palace." 
#2 Sm5-9: David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the terraces "inward. 
#2 Sm5-10: And he became more and more powerful, because the LORD God Almighty was with him. 
#2 Sm5-11: Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David. 
#2 Sm5-12: Then David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel. 
#2 Sm5-13: After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. 
#2 Sm5-14: These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
#2 Sm5-15: Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
#2 Sm5-16: Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet. 
#2 Sm5-17: When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold. 
#2 Sm5-18: Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim; 
#2 Sm5-19: so David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?" The LORD answered him, "Go, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hands." 
#2 Sm5-20: So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, "As waters break out, the LORD has broken out against my enemies before me." So that place was called Baal Perazim. [^3] 
#2 Sm5-21: The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off. 
#2 Sm5-22: Once more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim; 
#2 Sm5-23: so David inquired of the LORD, and he answered, "Do not go straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the poplar trees. 
#2 Sm5-24: As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move quickly, because that will mean the LORD has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army." 
#2 Sm5-25: So David did as the LORD commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon "to Gezer.
 2 SAMUEL 6
#2 Sm6-1: David again brought together all the able young men of Israel —thirty thousand. 
#2 Sm6-2: He and all his men went to Baalah "in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, "the name of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim on the ark. 
#2 Sm6-3: They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart 
#2 Sm6-4: with the ark of God on it, "and Ahio was walking in front of it. 
#2 Sm6-5: David and all Israel were celebrating with all their might before the LORD, with castanets, "harps, lyres, timbrels, sistrums and cymbals. 
#2 Sm6-6: When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled. 
#2 Sm6-7: The LORD's anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down, and he died there beside the ark of God. 
#2 Sm6-8: Then David was angry because the LORD's wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah. [^5] 
#2 Sm6-9: David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, "How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?" 
#2 Sm6-10: He was not willing to take the ark of the LORD to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
#2 Sm6-11: The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and his entire household. 
#2 Sm6-12: Now King David was told, "The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God." So David went to bring up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing. 
#2 Sm6-13: When those who were carrying the ark of the LORD had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf. 
#2 Sm6-14: Wearing a linen ephod, David was dancing before the LORD with all his might, 
#2 Sm6-15: while he and all Israel were bringing up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of trumpets. 
#2 Sm6-16: As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she despised him in her heart. 
#2 Sm6-17: They brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the LORD. 
#2 Sm6-18: After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD Almighty. 
#2 Sm6-19: Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes. 
#2 Sm6-20: When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, "How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, going around half-naked in full view of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!" 
#2 Sm6-21: David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the LORD's people Israel —I will celebrate before the LORD. 
#2 Sm6-22: I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor." 
#2 Sm6-23: And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
 2 SAMUEL 7
#2 Sm7-1: After the king was settled in his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him, 
#2 Sm7-2: he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent." 
#2 Sm7-3: Nathan replied to the king, "Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the LORD is with you." 
#2 Sm7-4: But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying: 
#2 Sm7-5: "Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in? 
#2 Sm7-6: I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling. 
#2 Sm7-7: Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"' 
#2 Sm7-8: "Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. 
#2 Sm7-9: I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men on earth. 
#2 Sm7-10: And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning 
#2 Sm7-11: and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders "over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. "'The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you: 
#2 Sm7-12: When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and I will establish his kingdom. 
#2 Sm7-13: He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 
#2 Sm7-14: I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands. 
#2 Sm7-15: But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 
#2 Sm7-16: Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me "; your throne will be established forever.'" 
#2 Sm7-17: Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation. 
#2 Sm7-18: Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said: "Who am I, Sovereign LORD, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far? 
#2 Sm7-19: And as if this were not enough in your sight, Sovereign LORD, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant —and this decree, Sovereign LORD, is for a mere human! [^3] 
#2 Sm7-20: "What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Sovereign LORD. 
#2 Sm7-21: For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant. 
#2 Sm7-22: "How great you are, Sovereign LORD! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears. 
#2 Sm7-23: And who is like your people Israel —the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt? [^4] 
#2 Sm7-24: You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, LORD, have become their God. 
#2 Sm7-25: "And now, LORD God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised, 
#2 Sm7-26: so that your name will be great forever. Then people will say, 'The LORD Almighty is God over Israel!' And the house of your servant David will be established in your sight. 
#2 Sm7-27: "LORD Almighty, God of Israel, you have revealed this to your servant, saying, 'I will build a house for you.' So your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you. 
#2 Sm7-28: Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your covenant is trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant. 
#2 Sm7-29: Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, Sovereign LORD, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever."
 2 SAMUEL 8
#2 Sm8-1: In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the control of the Philistines. 
#2 Sm8-2: David also defeated the Moabites. He made them lie down on the ground and measured them off with a length of cord. Every two lengths of them were put to death, and the third length was allowed to live. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute. 
#2 Sm8-3: Moreover, David defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his monument at "the Euphrates River. 
#2 Sm8-4: David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers "and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses. 
#2 Sm8-5: When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them. 
#2 Sm8-6: He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought tribute. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went. 
#2 Sm8-7: David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
#2 Sm8-8: From Tebah "and Berothai, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, King David took a great quantity of bronze. 
#2 Sm8-9: When Tou "king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer, 
#2 Sm8-10: he sent his son Joram "to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Joram brought with him articles of silver, of gold and of bronze. 
#2 Sm8-11: King David dedicated these articles to the LORD, as he had done with the silver and gold from all the nations he had subdued: 
#2 Sm8-12: Edom "and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek. He also dedicated the plunder taken from Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 
#2 Sm8-13: And David became famous after he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites "in the Valley of Salt. 
#2 Sm8-14: He put garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went. 
#2 Sm8-15: David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people. 
#2 Sm8-16: Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; 
#2 Sm8-17: Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelek son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was secretary; 
#2 Sm8-18: Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were priests. [^8]
 2 SAMUEL 9
#2 Sm9-1: David asked, "Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?" 
#2 Sm9-2: Now there was a servant of Saul's household named Ziba. They summoned him to appear before David, and the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" "At your service," he replied. 
#2 Sm9-3: The king asked, "Is there no one still alive from the house of Saul to whom I can show God's kindness?" Ziba answered the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan; he is lame in both feet." 
#2 Sm9-4: "Where is he?" the king asked. Ziba answered, "He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar." 
#2 Sm9-5: So King David had him brought from Lo Debar, from the house of Makir son of Ammiel. 
#2 Sm9-6: When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor. David said, "Mephibosheth!" "At your service," he replied. 
#2 Sm9-7: "Don't be afraid," David said to him, "for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table." 
#2 Sm9-8: Mephibosheth bowed down and said, "What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?" 
#2 Sm9-9: Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul's steward, and said to him, "I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
#2 Sm9-10: You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops, so that your master's grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table." (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.) 
#2 Sm9-11: Then Ziba said to the king, "Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do." So Mephibosheth ate at David's "table like one of the king's sons. 
#2 Sm9-12: Mephibosheth had a young son named Mika, and all the members of Ziba's household were servants of Mephibosheth. 
#2 Sm9-13: And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king's table; he was lame in both feet.
 2 SAMUEL 10
#2 Sm10-1: In the course of time, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun succeeded him as king. 
#2 Sm10-2: David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to the land of the Ammonites, 
#2 Sm10-3: the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Hasn't David sent them to you only to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?" 
#2 Sm10-4: So Hanun seized David's envoys, shaved off half of each man's beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away. 
#2 Sm10-5: When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back." 
#2 Sm10-6: When the Ammonites realized that they had become obnoxious to David, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maakah with a thousand men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob. 
#2 Sm10-7: On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men. 
#2 Sm10-8: The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maakah were by themselves in the open country. 
#2 Sm10-9: Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans. 
#2 Sm10-10: He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the Ammonites. 
#2 Sm10-11: Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you. 
#2 Sm10-12: Be strong, and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight." 
#2 Sm10-13: Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
#2 Sm10-14: When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they fled before Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem. 
#2 Sm10-15: After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they regrouped. 
#2 Sm10-16: Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River; they went to Helam, with Shobak the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them. 
#2 Sm10-17: When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan and went to Helam. The Arameans formed their battle lines to meet David and fought against him. 
#2 Sm10-18: But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. "He also struck down Shobak the commander of their army, and he died there. 
#2 Sm10-19: When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with the Israelites and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
 2 SAMUEL 11
#2 Sm11-1: In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king's men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem. 
#2 Sm11-2: One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful, 
#2 Sm11-3: and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, "She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite." 
#2 Sm11-4: Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her monthly uncleanness.) Then she went back home. 
#2 Sm11-5: The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, "I am pregnant." 
#2 Sm11-6: So David sent this word to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent him to David. 
#2 Sm11-7: When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going. 
#2 Sm11-8: Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him. 
#2 Sm11-9: But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master's servants and did not go down to his house. 
#2 Sm11-10: David was told, "Uriah did not go home." So he asked Uriah, "Haven't you just come from a military campaign? Why didn't you go home?" 
#2 Sm11-11: Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, "and my commander Joab and my lord's men are camped in the open country. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and make love to my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!" 
#2 Sm11-12: Then David said to him, "Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
#2 Sm11-13: At David's invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master's servants; he did not go home. 
#2 Sm11-14: In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 
#2 Sm11-15: In it he wrote, "Put Uriah out in front where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die." 
#2 Sm11-16: So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were. 
#2 Sm11-17: When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David's army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died. 
#2 Sm11-18: Joab sent David a full account of the battle. 
#2 Sm11-19: He instructed the messenger: "When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle, 
#2 Sm11-20: the king's anger may flare up, and he may ask you, 'Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn't you know they would shoot arrows from the wall? 
#2 Sm11-21: Who killed Abimelek son of Jerub-Besheth "? Didn't a woman drop an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?' If he asks you this, then say to him, 'Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.'" 
#2 Sm11-22: The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say. 
#2 Sm11-23: The messenger said to David, "The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate. 
#2 Sm11-24: Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king's men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead." 
#2 Sm11-25: David told the messenger, "Say this to Joab: 'Don't let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.' Say this to encourage Joab." 
#2 Sm11-26: When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. 
#2 Sm11-27: After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the LORD.
 2 SAMUEL 12
#2 Sm12-1: The LORD sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, "There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. 
#2 Sm12-2: The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, 
#2 Sm12-3: but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him. 
#2 Sm12-4: "Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him." 
#2 Sm12-5: David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this must die! 
#2 Sm12-6: He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity." 
#2 Sm12-7: Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. 
#2 Sm12-8: I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. 
#2 Sm12-9: Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. 
#2 Sm12-10: Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.' 
#2 Sm12-11: "This is what the LORD says: 'Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity on you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight. 
#2 Sm12-12: You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.'" 
#2 Sm12-13: Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "The LORD has taken away your sin. You are not going to die. 
#2 Sm12-14: But because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for "the LORD, the son born to you will die." 
#2 Sm12-15: After Nathan had gone home, the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became ill. 
#2 Sm12-16: David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth "on the ground. 
#2 Sm12-17: The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them. 
#2 Sm12-18: On the seventh day the child died. David's attendants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, "While the child was still living, he wouldn't listen to us when we spoke to him. How can we now tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate." 
#2 Sm12-19: David noticed that his attendants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child was dead. "Is the child dead?" he asked. "Yes," they replied, "he is dead." 
#2 Sm12-20: Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate. 
#2 Sm12-21: His attendants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!" 
#2 Sm12-22: He answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, 'Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let the child live.' 
#2 Sm12-23: But now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me." 
#2 Sm12-24: Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and made love to her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The LORD loved him; 
#2 Sm12-25: and because the LORD loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah. [^3] 
#2 Sm12-26: Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel. 
#2 Sm12-27: Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, "I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply. 
#2 Sm12-28: Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me." 
#2 Sm12-29: So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah, and attacked and captured it. 
#2 Sm12-30: David took the crown from their king's "head, and it was placed on his own head. It weighed a talent "of gold, and it was set with precious stones. David took a great quantity of plunder from the city 
#2 Sm12-31: and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes, and he made them work at brickmaking. "David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then he and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
 2 SAMUEL 13
#2 Sm13-1: In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David. 
#2 Sm13-2: Amnon became so obsessed with his sister Tamar that he made himself ill. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her. 
#2 Sm13-3: Now Amnon had an adviser named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man. 
#2 Sm13-4: He asked Amnon, "Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister." 
#2 Sm13-5: "Go to bed and pretend to be ill," Jonadab said. "When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'" 
#2 Sm13-6: So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, "I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand." 
#2 Sm13-7: David sent word to Tamar at the palace: "Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him." 
#2 Sm13-8: So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it. 
#2 Sm13-9: Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. "Send everyone out of here," Amnon said. So everyone left him. 
#2 Sm13-10: Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom. 
#2 Sm13-11: But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, "Come to bed with me, my sister." 
#2 Sm13-12: "No, my brother!" she said to him. "Don't force me! Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing. 
#2 Sm13-13: What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you." 
#2 Sm13-14: But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her. 
#2 Sm13-15: Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out!" 
#2 Sm13-16: "No!" she said to him. "Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me." But he refused to listen to her. 
#2 Sm13-17: He called his personal servant and said, "Get this woman out of my sight and bolt the door after her." 
#2 Sm13-18: So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing an ornate "robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore. 
#2 Sm13-19: Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornate robe she was wearing. She put her hands on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went. 
#2 Sm13-20: Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart." And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman. 
#2 Sm13-21: When King David heard all this, he was furious. 
#2 Sm13-22: And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar. 
#2 Sm13-23: Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there. 
#2 Sm13-24: Absalom went to the king and said, "Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his attendants please join me?" 
#2 Sm13-25: "No, my son," the king replied. "All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you." Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go but gave him his blessing. 
#2 Sm13-26: Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us." The king asked him, "Why should he go with you?" 
#2 Sm13-27: But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons. 
#2 Sm13-28: Absalom ordered his men, "Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be afraid. Haven't I given you this order? Be strong and brave." 
#2 Sm13-29: So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled. 
#2 Sm13-30: While they were on their way, the report came to David: "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left." 
#2 Sm13-31: The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his attendants stood by with their clothes torn. 
#2 Sm13-32: But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, "My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's express intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar. 
#2 Sm13-33: My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead." 
#2 Sm13-34: Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, "I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill." [^2] 
#2 Sm13-35: Jonadab said to the king, "See, the king's sons have come; it has happened just as your servant said." 
#2 Sm13-36: As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his attendants wept very bitterly. 
#2 Sm13-37: Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned many days for his son. 
#2 Sm13-38: After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years. 
#2 Sm13-39: And King David longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon's death.
 2 SAMUEL 14
#2 Sm14-1: Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart longed for Absalom. 
#2 Sm14-2: So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, "Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don't use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead. 
#2 Sm14-3: Then go to the king and speak these words to him." And Joab put the words in her mouth. 
#2 Sm14-4: When the woman from Tekoa went "to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, "Help me, Your Majesty!" 
#2 Sm14-5: The king asked her, "What is troubling you?" She said, "I am a widow; my husband is dead. 
#2 Sm14-6: I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him. 
#2 Sm14-7: Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, 'Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.' They would put out the only burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth." 
#2 Sm14-8: The king said to the woman, "Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf." 
#2 Sm14-9: But the woman from Tekoa said to him, "Let my lord the king pardon me and my family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt." 
#2 Sm14-10: The king replied, "If anyone says anything to you, bring them to me, and they will not bother you again." 
#2 Sm14-11: She said, "Then let the king invoke the LORD his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed." "As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "not one hair of your son's head will fall to the ground." 
#2 Sm14-12: Then the woman said, "Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king." "Speak," he replied. 
#2 Sm14-13: The woman said, "Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son? 
#2 Sm14-14: Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But that is not what God desires; rather, he devises ways so that a banished person does not remain banished from him. 
#2 Sm14-15: "And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king; perhaps he will grant his servant's request. 
#2 Sm14-16: Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from God's inheritance.' 
#2 Sm14-17: "And now your servant says, 'May the word of my lord the king secure my inheritance, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the LORD your God be with you.'" 
#2 Sm14-18: Then the king said to the woman, "Don't keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you." "Let my lord the king speak," the woman said. 
#2 Sm14-19: The king asked, "Isn't the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant. 
#2 Sm14-20: Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God —he knows everything that happens in the land." 
#2 Sm14-21: The king said to Joab, "Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom." 
#2 Sm14-22: Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant's request." 
#2 Sm14-23: Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
#2 Sm14-24: But the king said, "He must go to his own house; he must not see my face." So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king. 
#2 Sm14-25: In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him. 
#2 Sm14-26: Whenever he cut the hair of his head —he used to cut his hair once a year because it became too heavy for him —he would weigh it, and its weight was two hundred shekels "by the royal standard. 
#2 Sm14-27: Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. His daughter's name was Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman. 
#2 Sm14-28: Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king's face. 
#2 Sm14-29: Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come. 
#2 Sm14-30: Then he said to his servants, "Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire. 
#2 Sm14-31: Then Joab did go to Absalom's house, and he said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?" 
#2 Sm14-32: Absalom said to Joab, "Look, I sent word to you and said, 'Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there!"' Now then, I want to see the king's face, and if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death." 
#2 Sm14-33: So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
 2 SAMUEL 15
#2 Sm15-1: In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him. 
#2 Sm15-2: He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, "What town are you from?" He would answer, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel." 
#2 Sm15-3: Then Absalom would say to him, "Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you." 
#2 Sm15-4: And Absalom would add, "If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that they receive justice." 
#2 Sm15-5: Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him. 
#2 Sm15-6: Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the people of Israel. 
#2 Sm15-7: At the end of four "years, Absalom said to the king, "Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the LORD. 
#2 Sm15-8: While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: 'If the LORD takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron. "'" 
#2 Sm15-9: The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he went to Hebron. 
#2 Sm15-10: Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'" 
#2 Sm15-11: Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter. 
#2 Sm15-12: While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom's following kept on increasing. 
#2 Sm15-13: A messenger came and told David, "The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom." 
#2 Sm15-14: Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, "Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin on us and put the city to the sword." 
#2 Sm15-15: The king's officials answered him, "Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses." 
#2 Sm15-16: The king set out, with his entire household following him; but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace. 
#2 Sm15-17: So the king set out, with all the people following him, and they halted at the edge of the city. 
#2 Sm15-18: All his men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites; and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king. 
#2 Sm15-19: The king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland. 
#2 Sm15-20: You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your people with you. May the LORD show you kindness and faithfulness." [^3] 
#2 Sm15-21: But Ittai replied to the king, "As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be." 
#2 Sm15-22: David said to Ittai, "Go ahead, march on." So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him. 
#2 Sm15-23: The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness. 
#2 Sm15-24: Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city. 
#2 Sm15-25: Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the LORD's eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again. 
#2 Sm15-26: But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him." 
#2 Sm15-27: The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Do you understand? Go back to the city with my blessing. Take your son Ahimaaz with you, and also Abiathar's son Jonathan. You and Abiathar return with your two sons. 
#2 Sm15-28: I will wait at the fords in the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me." 
#2 Sm15-29: So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there. 
#2 Sm15-30: But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up. 
#2 Sm15-31: Now David had been told, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." So David prayed, "LORD, turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness." 
#2 Sm15-32: When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head. 
#2 Sm15-33: David said to him, "If you go with me, you will be a burden to me. 
#2 Sm15-34: But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'Your Majesty, I will be your servant; I was your father's servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,' then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel's advice. 
#2 Sm15-35: Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace. 
#2 Sm15-36: Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear." 
#2 Sm15-37: So Hushai, David's confidant, arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.
 2 SAMUEL 16
#2 Sm16-1: When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine. 
#2 Sm16-2: The king asked Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness." 
#2 Sm16-3: The king then asked, "Where is your master's grandson?" Ziba said to him, "He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, 'Today the Israelites will restore to me my grandfather's kingdom.'" 
#2 Sm16-4: Then the king said to Ziba, "All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." "I humbly bow," Ziba said. "May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king." 
#2 Sm16-5: As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul's family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out. 
#2 Sm16-6: He pelted David and all the king's officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David's right and left. 
#2 Sm16-7: As he cursed, Shimei said, "Get out, get out, you murderer, you scoundrel! 
#2 Sm16-8: The LORD has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The LORD has given the kingdom into the hands of your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a murderer!" 
#2 Sm16-9: Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head." 
#2 Sm16-10: But the king said, "What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD said to him, 'Curse David,' who can ask, 'Why do you do this?'" 
#2 Sm16-11: David then said to Abishai and all his officials, "My son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the LORD has told him to. 
#2 Sm16-12: It may be that the LORD will look upon my misery and restore to me his covenant blessing instead of his curse today." 
#2 Sm16-13: So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt. 
#2 Sm16-14: The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself. 
#2 Sm16-15: Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. 
#2 Sm16-16: Then Hushai the Arkite, David's confidant, went to Absalom and said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!" 
#2 Sm16-17: Absalom said to Hushai, "So this is the love you show your friend? If he's your friend, why didn't you go with him?" 
#2 Sm16-18: Hushai said to Absalom, "No, the one chosen by the LORD, by these people, and by all the men of Israel —his I will be, and I will remain with him. 
#2 Sm16-19: Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you." 
#2 Sm16-20: Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice. What should we do?" 
#2 Sm16-21: Ahithophel answered, "Sleep with your father's concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself obnoxious to your father, and the hands of everyone with you will be more resolute." 
#2 Sm16-22: So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
#2 Sm16-23: Now in those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophel's advice.
 2 SAMUEL 17
#2 Sm17-1: Ahithophel said to Absalom, "I would "choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David. 
#2 Sm17-2: I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king 
#2 Sm17-3: and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed." 
#2 Sm17-4: This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel. 
#2 Sm17-5: But Absalom said, "Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say as well." 
#2 Sm17-6: When Hushai came to him, Absalom said, "Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not, give us your opinion." 
#2 Sm17-7: Hushai replied to Absalom, "The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time. 
#2 Sm17-8: You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced fighter; he will not spend the night with the troops. 
#2 Sm17-9: Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first, "whoever hears about it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.' 
#2 Sm17-10: Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave. 
#2 Sm17-11: "So I advise you: Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba —as numerous as the sand on the seashore —be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle. 
#2 Sm17-12: Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive. 
#2 Sm17-13: If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not so much as a pebble is left." 
#2 Sm17-14: Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel." For the LORD had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom. 
#2 Sm17-15: Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, "Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so. 
#2 Sm17-16: Now send a message at once and tell David, 'Do not spend the night at the fords in the wilderness; cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.'" 
#2 Sm17-17: Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A female servant was to go and inform them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city. 
#2 Sm17-18: But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left at once and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it. 
#2 Sm17-19: His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it. 
#2 Sm17-20: When Absalom's men came to the woman at the house, they asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman answered them, "They crossed over the brook." "The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem. 
#2 Sm17-21: After they had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him, "Set out and cross the river at once; Ahithophel has advised such and such against you." 
#2 Sm17-22: So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan. 
#2 Sm17-23: When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father's tomb. 
#2 Sm17-24: David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. 
#2 Sm17-25: Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of Jether, "an Ishmaelite "who had married Abigal, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab. 
#2 Sm17-26: The Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. 
#2 Sm17-27: When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Makir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 
#2 Sm17-28: brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery. They also brought wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans and lentils, [^6] 
#2 Sm17-29: honey and curds, sheep, and cheese from cows' milk for David and his people to eat. For they said, "The people have become exhausted and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness."
 2 SAMUEL 18
#2 Sm18-1: David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 
#2 Sm18-2: David sent out his troops, a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, "I myself will surely march out with you." 
#2 Sm18-3: But the men said, "You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care; but you are worth ten thousand of us. "It would be better now for you to give us support from the city." 
#2 Sm18-4: The king answered, "I will do whatever seems best to you." So the king stood beside the gate while all his men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands. 
#2 Sm18-5: The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, "Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake." And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders. 
#2 Sm18-6: David's army marched out of the city to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
#2 Sm18-7: There Israel's troops were routed by David's men, and the casualties that day were great —twenty thousand men. 
#2 Sm18-8: The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest swallowed up more men that day than the sword. 
#2 Sm18-9: Now Absalom happened to meet David's men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom's hair got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going. 
#2 Sm18-10: When one of the men saw what had happened, he told Joab, "I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree." 
#2 Sm18-11: Joab said to the man who had told him this, "What! You saw him? Why didn't you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels "of silver and a warrior's belt." 
#2 Sm18-12: But the man replied, "Even if a thousand shekels "were weighed out into my hands, I would not lay a hand on the king's son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom for my sake. "' 
#2 Sm18-13: And if I had put my life in jeopardy "—and nothing is hidden from the king —you would have kept your distance from me." 
#2 Sm18-14: Joab said, "I'm not going to wait like this for you." So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom's heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree. 
#2 Sm18-15: And ten of Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him. 
#2 Sm18-16: Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them. 
#2 Sm18-17: They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes. 
#2 Sm18-18: During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King's Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, "I have no son to carry on the memory of my name." He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this day. 
#2 Sm18-19: Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Let me run and take the news to the king that the LORD has vindicated him by delivering him from the hand of his enemies." 
#2 Sm18-20: "You are not the one to take the news today," Joab told him. "You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king's son is dead." 
#2 Sm18-21: Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off. 
#2 Sm18-22: Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, "Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite." But Joab replied, "My son, why do you want to go? You don't have any news that will bring you a reward." 
#2 Sm18-23: He said, "Come what may, I want to run." So Joab said, "Run!" Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain "and outran the Cushite. 
#2 Sm18-24: While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone. 
#2 Sm18-25: The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said, "If he is alone, he must have good news." And the runner came closer and closer. 
#2 Sm18-26: Then the watchman saw another runner, and he called down to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man running alone!" The king said, "He must be bringing good news, too." 
#2 Sm18-27: The watchman said, "It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok." "He's a good man," the king said. "He comes with good news." 
#2 Sm18-28: Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Praise be to the LORD your God! He has delivered up those who lifted their hands against my lord the king." 
#2 Sm18-29: The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz answered, "I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was." 
#2 Sm18-30: The king said, "Stand aside and wait here." So he stepped aside and stood there. 
#2 Sm18-31: Then the Cushite arrived and said, "My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has vindicated you today by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you." 
#2 Sm18-32: The king asked the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" The Cushite replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man." 
#2 Sm18-33: The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you —O Absalom, my son, my son!" [^7]
 2 SAMUEL 19
#2 Sm19-1: Joab was told, "The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom." 
#2 Sm19-2: And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, "The king is grieving for his son." 
#2 Sm19-3: The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle. 
#2 Sm19-4: The king covered his face and cried aloud, "O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!" 
#2 Sm19-5: Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, "Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines. 
#2 Sm19-6: You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead. 
#2 Sm19-7: Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the LORD that if you don't go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come on you from your youth till now." 
#2 Sm19-8: So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, "The king is sitting in the gateway," they all came before him. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes. 
#2 Sm19-9: Throughout the tribes of Israel, all the people were arguing among themselves, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country to escape from Absalom; 
#2 Sm19-10: and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?" 
#2 Sm19-11: King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: "Ask the elders of Judah, 'Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters? 
#2 Sm19-12: You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?' 
#2 Sm19-13: And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you are not the commander of my army for life in place of Joab.'" 
#2 Sm19-14: He won over the hearts of the men of Judah so that they were all of one mind. They sent word to the king, "Return, you and all your men." 
#2 Sm19-15: Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan. 
#2 Sm19-16: Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David. 
#2 Sm19-17: With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul's household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was. 
#2 Sm19-18: They crossed at the ford to take the king's household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king 
#2 Sm19-19: and said to him, "May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind. 
#2 Sm19-20: For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first from the tribes of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king." 
#2 Sm19-21: Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the LORD's anointed." 
#2 Sm19-22: David replied, "What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? What right do you have to interfere? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don't I know that today I am king over Israel?" 
#2 Sm19-23: So the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king promised him on oath. 
#2 Sm19-24: Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely. 
#2 Sm19-25: When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?" 
#2 Sm19-26: He said, "My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, 'I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.' But Ziba my servant betrayed me. 
#2 Sm19-27: And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever you wish. 
#2 Sm19-28: All my grandfather's descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?" 
#2 Sm19-29: The king said to him, "Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the land." 
#2 Sm19-30: Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has returned home safely." 
#2 Sm19-31: Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there. 
#2 Sm19-32: Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. 
#2 Sm19-33: The king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you." 
#2 Sm19-34: But Barzillai answered the king, "How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? 
#2 Sm19-35: I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 
#2 Sm19-36: Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way? 
#2 Sm19-37: Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you wish." 
#2 Sm19-38: The king said, "Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever you wish. And anything you desire from me I will do for you." 
#2 Sm19-39: So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and bid him farewell, and Barzillai returned to his home. 
#2 Sm19-40: When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over. 
#2 Sm19-41: Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?" 
#2 Sm19-42: All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king's provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?" 
#2 Sm19-43: Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king; so we have a greater claim on David than you have. Why then do you treat us with contempt? Weren't we the first to speak of bringing back our king?" But the men of Judah pressed their claims even more forcefully than the men of Israel.
 2 SAMUEL 20
#2 Sm20-1: Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted, "We have no share in David, no part in Jesse's son! Every man to his tent, Israel!" 
#2 Sm20-2: So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem. 
#2 Sm20-3: When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them but had no sexual relations with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows. 
#2 Sm20-4: Then the king said to Amasa, "Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself." 
#2 Sm20-5: But when Amasa went to summon Judah, he took longer than the time the king had set for him. 
#2 Sm20-6: David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son of Bikri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master's men and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us." [^1] 
#2 Sm20-7: So Joab's men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bikri. 
#2 Sm20-8: While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic, and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward, it dropped out of its sheath. 
#2 Sm20-9: Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 
#2 Sm20-10: Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joab's hand, and Joab plunged it into his belly, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. Without being stabbed again, Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bikri. 
#2 Sm20-11: One of Joab's men stood beside Amasa and said, "Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!" 
#2 Sm20-12: Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there. When he realized that everyone who came up to Amasa stopped, he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him. 
#2 Sm20-13: After Amasa had been removed from the road, everyone went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bikri. 
#2 Sm20-14: Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maakah and through the entire region of the Bikrites, "who gathered together and followed him. 
#2 Sm20-15: All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maakah. They built a siege ramp up to the city, and it stood against the outer fortifications. While they were battering the wall to bring it down, 
#2 Sm20-16: a wise woman called from the city, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him." 
#2 Sm20-17: He went toward her, and she asked, "Are you Joab?" "I am," he answered. She said, "Listen to what your servant has to say." "I'm listening," he said. 
#2 Sm20-18: She continued, "Long ago they used to say, 'Get your answer at Abel,' and that settled it. 
#2 Sm20-19: We are the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the LORD's inheritance?" 
#2 Sm20-20: "Far be it from me!" Joab replied, "Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy! 
#2 Sm20-21: That is not the case. A man named Sheba son of Bikri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Hand over this one man, and I'll withdraw from the city." The woman said to Joab, "His head will be thrown to you from the wall." 
#2 Sm20-22: Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bikri and threw it to Joab. So he sounded the trumpet, and his men dispersed from the city, each returning to his home. And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem. 
#2 Sm20-23: Joab was over Israel's entire army; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; 
#2 Sm20-24: Adoniram "was in charge of forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder; 
#2 Sm20-25: Sheva was secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
#2 Sm20-26: and Ira the Jairite "was David's priest.
 2 SAMUEL 21
#2 Sm21-1: During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the LORD. The LORD said, "It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death." 
#2 Sm21-2: The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.) 
#2 Sm21-3: David asked the Gibeonites, "What shall I do for you? How shall I make atonement so that you will bless the LORD's inheritance?" 
#2 Sm21-4: The Gibeonites answered him, "We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death." "What do you want me to do for you?" David asked. 
#2 Sm21-5: They answered the king, "As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel, 
#2 Sm21-6: let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and their bodies exposed before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul —the LORD's chosen one." So the king said, "I will give them to you." 
#2 Sm21-7: The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul. 
#2 Sm21-8: But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, "whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 
#2 Sm21-9: He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed them and exposed their bodies on a hill before the LORD. All seven of them fell together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning. 
#2 Sm21-10: Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds touch them by day or the wild animals by night. 
#2 Sm21-11: When David was told what Aiah's daughter Rizpah, Saul's concubine, had done, 
#2 Sm21-12: he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had stolen their bodies from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.) 
#2 Sm21-13: David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up. 
#2 Sm21-14: They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul's father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land. 
#2 Sm21-15: Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted. 
#2 Sm21-16: And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels "and who was armed with a new sword, said he would kill David. 
#2 Sm21-17: But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, saying, "Never again will you go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished." 
#2 Sm21-18: In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha. 
#2 Sm21-19: In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair "the Bethlehemite killed the brother of "Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod. 
#2 Sm21-20: In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot —twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha. 
#2 Sm21-21: When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. 
#2 Sm21-22: These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
 2 SAMUEL 22
#2 Sm22-1: David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. 
#2 Sm22-2: He said: "The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; 
#2 Sm22-3: my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield "and the horn "of my salvation. He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior — from violent people you save me. 
#2 Sm22-4: "I called to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and have been saved from my enemies. 
#2 Sm22-5: The waves of death swirled about me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. 
#2 Sm22-6: The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me. 
#2 Sm22-7: "In my distress I called to the LORD; I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came to his ears. 
#2 Sm22-8: The earth trembled and quaked, the foundations of the heavens "shook; they trembled because he was angry. 
#2 Sm22-9: Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it. 
#2 Sm22-10: He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet. 
#2 Sm22-11: He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared "on the wings of the wind. 
#2 Sm22-12: He made darkness his canopy around him — the dark "rain clouds of the sky. 
#2 Sm22-13: Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth. 
#2 Sm22-14: The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. 
#2 Sm22-15: He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, with great bolts of lightning he routed them. 
#2 Sm22-16: The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of breath from his nostrils. 
#2 Sm22-17: "He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters. 
#2 Sm22-18: He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me. 
#2 Sm22-19: They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support. 
#2 Sm22-20: He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me. 
#2 Sm22-21: "The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me. 
#2 Sm22-22: For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I am not guilty of turning from my God. 
#2 Sm22-23: All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees. 
#2 Sm22-24: I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin. 
#2 Sm22-25: The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness "in his sight. 
#2 Sm22-26: "To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless, 
#2 Sm22-27: to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the devious you show yourself shrewd. 
#2 Sm22-28: You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low. 
#2 Sm22-29: You, LORD, are my lamp; the LORD turns my darkness into light. 
#2 Sm22-30: With your help I can advance against a troop "; with my God I can scale a wall. 
#2 Sm22-31: "As for God, his way is perfect: The LORD's word is flawless; he shields all who take refuge in him. 
#2 Sm22-32: For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God? 
#2 Sm22-33: It is God who arms me with strength "and keeps my way secure. 
#2 Sm22-34: He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he causes me to stand on the heights. 
#2 Sm22-35: He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 
#2 Sm22-36: You make your saving help my shield; your help has made "me great. 
#2 Sm22-37: You provide a broad path for my feet, so that my ankles do not give way. 
#2 Sm22-38: "I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed. 
#2 Sm22-39: I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet. 
#2 Sm22-40: You armed me with strength for battle; you humbled my adversaries before me. 
#2 Sm22-41: You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes. 
#2 Sm22-42: They cried for help, but there was no one to save them — to the LORD, but he did not answer. 
#2 Sm22-43: I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets. 
#2 Sm22-44: "You have delivered me from the attacks of the peoples; you have preserved me as the head of nations. People I did not know now serve me, 
#2 Sm22-45: foreigners cower before me; as soon as they hear of me, they obey me. 
#2 Sm22-46: They all lose heart; they come trembling "from their strongholds. 
#2 Sm22-47: "The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be my God, the Rock, my Savior! 
#2 Sm22-48: He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me, 
#2 Sm22-49: who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from a violent man you rescued me. 
#2 Sm22-50: Therefore I will praise you, LORD, among the nations; I will sing the praises of your name. 
#2 Sm22-51: "He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever."
 2 SAMUEL 23
#2 Sm23-1: These are the last words of David: "The inspired utterance of David son of Jesse, the utterance of the man exalted by the Most High, the man anointed by the God of Jacob, the hero of Israel's songs: 
#2 Sm23-2: "The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me; his word was on my tongue. 
#2 Sm23-3: The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel said to me: 'When one rules over people in righteousness, when he rules in the fear of God, 
#2 Sm23-4: he is like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning, like the brightness after rain that brings grass from the earth.' 
#2 Sm23-5: "If my house were not right with God, surely he would not have made with me an everlasting covenant, arranged and secured in every part; surely he would not bring to fruition my salvation and grant me my every desire. 
#2 Sm23-6: But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns, which are not gathered with the hand. 
#2 Sm23-7: Whoever touches thorns uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear; they are burned up where they lie." 
#2 Sm23-8: These are the names of David's mighty warriors: Josheb-Basshebeth, "a Tahkemonite, "was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed "in one encounter. 
#2 Sm23-9: Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty warriors, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim "for battle. Then the Israelites retreated, 
#2 Sm23-10: but Eleazar stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead. 
#2 Sm23-11: Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel's troops fled from them. 
#2 Sm23-12: But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory. 
#2 Sm23-13: During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
#2 Sm23-14: At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. 
#2 Sm23-15: David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!" 
#2 Sm23-16: So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. 
#2 Sm23-17: "Far be it from me, LORD, to do this!" he said. "Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?" And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors. 
#2 Sm23-18: Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three. "He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. 
#2 Sm23-19: Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them. 
#2 Sm23-20: Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab's two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 
#2 Sm23-21: And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. 
#2 Sm23-22: Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. 
#2 Sm23-23: He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. 
#2 Sm23-24: Among the Thirty were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem, 
#2 Sm23-25: Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 
#2 Sm23-26: Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, 
#2 Sm23-27: Abiezer from Anathoth, Sibbekai "the Hushathite, 
#2 Sm23-28: Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
#2 Sm23-29: Heled "son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin, 
#2 Sm23-30: Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai "from the ravines of Gaash, 
#2 Sm23-31: Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
#2 Sm23-32: Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan 
#2 Sm23-33: son of "Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar "the Hararite, 
#2 Sm23-34: Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maakathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
#2 Sm23-35: Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 
#2 Sm23-36: Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, the son of Hagri, [^11] 
#2 Sm23-37: Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah, 
#2 Sm23-38: Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite 
#2 Sm23-39: and Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven in all.
 2 SAMUEL 24
#2 Sm24-1: Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go and take a census of Israel and Judah." 
#2 Sm24-2: So the king said to Joab and the army commanders "with him, "Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are." 
#2 Sm24-3: But Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?" 
#2 Sm24-4: The king's word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel. 
#2 Sm24-5: After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer. 
#2 Sm24-6: They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon. 
#2 Sm24-7: Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah. 
#2 Sm24-8: After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
#2 Sm24-9: Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand. 
#2 Sm24-10: David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, LORD, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing." 
#2 Sm24-11: Before David got up the next morning, the word of the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David's seer: 
#2 Sm24-12: "Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'" 
#2 Sm24-13: So Gad went to David and said to him, "Shall there come on you three "years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me." 
#2 Sm24-14: David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into human hands." 
#2 Sm24-15: So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. 
#2 Sm24-16: When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 
#2 Sm24-17: When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the LORD, "I have sinned; I, the shepherd, "have done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall on me and my family." 
#2 Sm24-18: On that day Gad went to David and said to him, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite." 
#2 Sm24-19: So David went up, as the LORD had commanded through Gad. 
#2 Sm24-20: When Araunah looked and saw the king and his officials coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 
#2 Sm24-21: Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" "To buy your threshing floor," David answered, "so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped." 
#2 Sm24-22: Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. 
#2 Sm24-23: Your Majesty, Araunah "gives all this to the king." Araunah also said to him, "May the LORD your God accept you." 
#2 Sm24-24: But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels "of silver for them. 
#2 Sm24-25: David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the LORD answered his prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.

#1 Rs1-1: When King David was very old, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him. 
#1 Rs1-2: So his attendants said to him, "Let us look for a young virgin to serve the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm." 
#1 Rs1-3: Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
#1 Rs1-4: The woman was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no sexual relations with her. 
#1 Rs1-5: Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, "I will be king." So he got chariots and horses "ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him. 
#1 Rs1-6: (His father had never rebuked him by asking, "Why do you behave as you do?" He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.) 
#1 Rs1-7: Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support. 
#1 Rs1-8: But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David's special guard did not join Adonijah. 
#1 Rs1-9: Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah, 
#1 Rs1-10: but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon. 
#1 Rs1-11: Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our lord David knows nothing about it? 
#1 Rs1-12: Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 
#1 Rs1-13: Go in to King David and say to him, 'My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: "Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?' 
#1 Rs1-14: While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and add my word to what you have said." 
#1 Rs1-15: So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him. 
#1 Rs1-16: Bathsheba bowed down, prostrating herself before the king. "What is it you want?" the king asked. 
#1 Rs1-17: She said to him, "My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the LORD your God: 'Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.' 
#1 Rs1-18: But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it. 
#1 Rs1-19: He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant. 
#1 Rs1-20: My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
#1 Rs1-21: Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his ancestors, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals." 
#1 Rs1-22: While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
#1 Rs1-23: And the king was told, "Nathan the prophet is here." So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground. 
#1 Rs1-24: Nathan said, "Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne? 
#1 Rs1-25: Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!' 
#1 Rs1-26: But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite. 
#1 Rs1-27: Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?" 
#1 Rs1-28: Then King David said, "Call in Bathsheba." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him. 
#1 Rs1-29: The king then took an oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble, 
#1 Rs1-30: I will surely carry out this very day what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place." 
#1 Rs1-31: Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, prostrating herself before the king, and said, "May my lord King David live forever!" 
#1 Rs1-32: King David said, "Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came before the king, 
#1 Rs1-33: he said to them: "Take your lord's servants with you and have Solomon my son mount my own mule and take him down to Gihon. 
#1 Rs1-34: There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!' 
#1 Rs1-35: Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah." 
#1 Rs1-36: Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it. 
#1 Rs1-37: As the LORD was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!" 
#1 Rs1-38: So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon mount King David's mule, and they escorted him to Gihon. 
#1 Rs1-39: Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!" 
#1 Rs1-40: And all the people went up after him, playing pipes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound. 
#1 Rs1-41: Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, "What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?" 
#1 Rs1-42: Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news." 
#1 Rs1-43: "Not at all!" Jonathan answered. "Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 
#1 Rs1-44: The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule, 
#1 Rs1-45: and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear. 
#1 Rs1-46: Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. 
#1 Rs1-47: Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed 
#1 Rs1-48: and said, 'Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'" 
#1 Rs1-49: At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed. 
#1 Rs1-50: But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar. 
#1 Rs1-51: Then Solomon was told, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'" 
#1 Rs1-52: Solomon replied, "If he shows himself to be worthy, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die." 
#1 Rs1-53: Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, "Go to your home."
 1 REIS 2
#1 Rs2-1: When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son. 
#1 Rs2-2: "I am about to go the way of all the earth," he said. "So be strong, act like a man, 
#1 Rs2-3: and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in obedience to him, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and regulations, as written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go 
#1 Rs2-4: and that the LORD may keep his promise to me: 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.' 
#1 Rs2-5: "Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me —what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. 
#1 Rs2-6: Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace. 
#1 Rs2-7: "But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom. 
#1 Rs2-8: "And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.' 
#1 Rs2-9: But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood." 
#1 Rs2-10: Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. 
#1 Rs2-11: He had reigned forty years over Israel —seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. 
#1 Rs2-12: So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established. 
#1 Rs2-13: Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Bathsheba asked him, "Do you come peacefully?" He answered, "Yes, peacefully." 
#1 Rs2-14: Then he added, "I have something to say to you." "You may say it," she replied. 
#1 Rs2-15: "As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD. 
#1 Rs2-16: Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me." "You may make it," she said. 
#1 Rs2-17: So he continued, "Please ask King Solomon —he will not refuse you —to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife." 
#1 Rs2-18: "Very well," Bathsheba replied, "I will speak to the king for you." 
#1 Rs2-19: When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand. 
#1 Rs2-20: "I have one small request to make of you," she said. "Do not refuse me." The king replied, "Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you." 
#1 Rs2-21: So she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah." 
#1 Rs2-22: King Solomon answered his mother, "Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him —after all, he is my older brother —yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!" 
#1 Rs2-23: Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request! 
#1 Rs2-24: And now, as surely as the LORD lives —he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised —Adonijah shall be put to death today!" 
#1 Rs2-25: So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died. 
#1 Rs2-26: To Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships." 
#1 Rs2-27: So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli. 
#1 Rs2-28: When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar. 
#1 Rs2-29: King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, "Go, strike him down!" 
#1 Rs2-30: So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, "The king says, 'Come out!'" But he answered, "No, I will die here." Benaiah reported to the king, "This is how Joab answered me." 
#1 Rs2-31: Then the king commanded Benaiah, "Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed. 
#1 Rs2-32: The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without my father David knowing it he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them —Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army —were better men and more upright than he. 
#1 Rs2-33: May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD's peace forever." 
#1 Rs2-34: So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried at his home out in the country. 
#1 Rs2-35: The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest. 
#1 Rs2-36: Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. 
#1 Rs2-37: The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head." 
#1 Rs2-38: Shimei answered the king, "What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said." And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time. 
#1 Rs2-39: But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maakah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, "Your slaves are in Gath." 
#1 Rs2-40: At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath. 
#1 Rs2-41: When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, 
#1 Rs2-42: the king summoned Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, 'On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die'? At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I will obey.' 
#1 Rs2-43: Why then did you not keep your oath to the LORD and obey the command I gave you?" 
#1 Rs2-44: The king also said to Shimei, "You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your wrongdoing. 
#1 Rs2-45: But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain secure before the LORD forever." 
#1 Rs2-46: Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and he died. The kingdom was now established in Solomon's hands.
 1 REIS 3
#1 Rs3-1: Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he finished building his palace and the temple of the LORD, and the wall around Jerusalem. 
#1 Rs3-2: The people, however, were still sacrificing at the high places, because a temple had not yet been built for the Name of the LORD. 
#1 Rs3-3: Solomon showed his love for the LORD by walking according to the instructions given him by his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places. 
#1 Rs3-4: The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for that was the most important high place, and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 
#1 Rs3-5: At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream, and God said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you." 
#1 Rs3-6: Solomon answered, "You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day. 
#1 Rs3-7: "Now, LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David. But I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties. 
#1 Rs3-8: Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number. 
#1 Rs3-9: So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?" 
#1 Rs3-10: The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this. 
#1 Rs3-11: So God said to him, "Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice, 
#1 Rs3-12: I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be. 
#1 Rs3-13: Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for —both wealth and honor —so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings. 
#1 Rs3-14: And if you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life." 
#1 Rs3-15: Then Solomon awoke —and he realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord's covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court. 
#1 Rs3-16: Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. 
#1 Rs3-17: One of them said, "Pardon me, my lord. This woman and I live in the same house, and I had a baby while she was there with me. 
#1 Rs3-18: The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us. 
#1 Rs3-19: "During the night this woman's son died because she lay on him. 
#1 Rs3-20: So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast. 
#1 Rs3-21: The next morning, I got up to nurse my son —and he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn't the son I had borne." 
#1 Rs3-22: The other woman said, "No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours." But the first one insisted, "No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine." And so they argued before the king. 
#1 Rs3-23: The king said, "This one says, 'My son is alive and your son is dead,' while that one says, 'No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.'" 
#1 Rs3-24: Then the king said, "Bring me a sword." So they brought a sword for the king. 
#1 Rs3-25: He then gave an order: "Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other." 
#1 Rs3-26: The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king, "Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don't kill him!" But the other said, "Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!" 
#1 Rs3-27: Then the king gave his ruling: "Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother." 
#1 Rs3-28: When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.
 1 REIS 4
#1 Rs4-1: So King Solomon ruled over all Israel.

#1 Rs4-18: Shimei son of Ela-in Benjamin; 
#1 Rs4-19: Geber son of Uri-in Gilead (the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and the country of Og king of Bashan). He was the only governor over the district. 
#1 Rs4-20: The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they ate, they drank and they were happy. 
#1 Rs4-21: And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These countries brought tribute and were Solomon's subjects all his life. 
#1 Rs4-22: Solomon's daily provisions were thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal, 
#1 Rs4-23: ten head of stall-fed cattle, twenty of pasture-fed cattle and a hundred sheep and goats, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks and choice fowl. 
#1 Rs4-24: For he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and had peace on all sides. 
#1 Rs4-25: During Solomon's lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety, each man under his own vine and fig tree. 
#1 Rs4-26: Solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses, and twelve thousand horses. 
#1 Rs4-27: The district officers, each in his month, supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to the king's table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking. 
#1 Rs4-28: They also brought to the proper place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and the other horses. 
#1 Rs4-29: God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore. 
#1 Rs4-30: Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the men of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. 
#1 Rs4-31: He was wiser than any other man, including Ethan the Ezrahite-wiser than Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations.

 1 REIS 5
#1 Rs5-1: When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David. 
#1 Rs5-2: Solomon sent back this message to Hiram: 
#1 Rs5-3: "You know that because of the wars waged against my father David from all sides, he could not build a temple for the Name of the LORD his God until the LORD put his enemies under his feet. 
#1 Rs5-4: But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or disaster. 
#1 Rs5-5: I intend, therefore, to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God, as the LORD told my father David, when he said, 'Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.' 
#1 Rs5-6: "So give orders that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians." 
#1 Rs5-7: When Hiram heard Solomon's message, he was greatly pleased and said, "Praise be to the LORD today, for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation." 
#1 Rs5-8: So Hiram sent word to Solomon: "I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and juniper logs. 
#1 Rs5-9: My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea, and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household." 
#1 Rs5-10: In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and juniper logs he wanted, 
#1 Rs5-11: and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors "of wheat as food for his household, in addition to twenty thousand baths ""of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year. 
#1 Rs5-12: The LORD gave Solomon wisdom, just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. 
#1 Rs5-13: King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel —thirty thousand men. 
#1 Rs5-14: He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. 
#1 Rs5-15: Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills, 
#1 Rs5-16: as well as thirty-three hundred "foremen who supervised the project and directed the workers. 
#1 Rs5-17: At the king's command they removed from the quarry large blocks of high-grade stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple. 
#1 Rs5-18: The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and workers from Byblos cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple.
 1 REIS 6
#1 Rs6-1: In the four hundred and eightieth "year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the LORD. 
#1 Rs6-2: The temple that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high. [^2] 
#1 Rs6-3: The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits, "and projected ten cubits "from the front of the temple. 
#1 Rs6-4: He made narrow windows high up in the temple walls. 
#1 Rs6-5: Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms. 
#1 Rs6-6: The lowest floor was five cubits "wide, the middle floor six cubits "and the third floor seven. "He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls. 
#1 Rs6-7: In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built. 
#1 Rs6-8: The entrance to the lowest "floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third. 
#1 Rs6-9: So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks. 
#1 Rs6-10: And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar. 
#1 Rs6-11: The word of the LORD came to Solomon: 
#1 Rs6-12: "As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, observe my laws and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father. 
#1 Rs6-13: And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel." 
#1 Rs6-14: So Solomon built the temple and completed it. 
#1 Rs6-15: He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of juniper. 
#1 Rs6-16: He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. 
#1 Rs6-17: The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits "long. 
#1 Rs6-18: The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen. 
#1 Rs6-19: He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there. 
#1 Rs6-20: The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar. 
#1 Rs6-21: Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. 
#1 Rs6-22: So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary. 
#1 Rs6-23: For the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim out of olive wood, each ten cubits high. 
#1 Rs6-24: One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits —ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip. 
#1 Rs6-25: The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape. 
#1 Rs6-26: The height of each cherub was ten cubits. 
#1 Rs6-27: He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room. 
#1 Rs6-28: He overlaid the cherubim with gold. 
#1 Rs6-29: On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers. 
#1 Rs6-30: He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold. 
#1 Rs6-31: For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors out of olive wood that were one fifth of the width of the sanctuary. 
#1 Rs6-32: And on the two olive-wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold. 
#1 Rs6-33: In the same way, for the entrance to the main hall he made doorframes out of olive wood that were one fourth of the width of the hall. 
#1 Rs6-34: He also made two doors out of juniper wood, each having two leaves that turned in sockets. 
#1 Rs6-35: He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings. 
#1 Rs6-36: And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams. 
#1 Rs6-37: The foundation of the temple of the LORD was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv. 
#1 Rs6-38: In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.
 1 REIS 7
#1 Rs7-1: It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace. 
#1 Rs7-2: He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high, "with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams. 
#1 Rs7-3: It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns —forty-five beams, fifteen to a row. 
#1 Rs7-4: Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other. 
#1 Rs7-5: All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other. [^2] 
#1 Rs7-6: He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide. "In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof. 
#1 Rs7-7: He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling. [^4] 
#1 Rs7-8: And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married. 
#1 Rs7-9: All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed on their inner and outer faces. 
#1 Rs7-10: The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits "and some eight. [^6] 
#1 Rs7-11: Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. 
#1 Rs7-12: The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the LORD with its portico. 
#1 Rs7-13: King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram, [^7] 
#1 Rs7-14: whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was from Tyre and a skilled craftsman in bronze. Huram was filled with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge to do all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him. 
#1 Rs7-15: He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference. [^8] 
#1 Rs7-16: He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits "high. 
#1 Rs7-17: A network of interwoven chains adorned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital. 
#1 Rs7-18: He made pomegranates in two rows "encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. "He did the same for each capital. 
#1 Rs7-19: The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits "high. 
#1 Rs7-20: On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around. 
#1 Rs7-21: He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin "and the one to the north Boaz. [^14] 
#1 Rs7-22: The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed. 
#1 Rs7-23: He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits "to measure around it. 
#1 Rs7-24: Below the rim, gourds encircled it —ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea. 
#1 Rs7-25: The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. 
#1 Rs7-26: It was a handbreadth "in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths. [^17] 
#1 Rs7-27: He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high. [^18] 
#1 Rs7-28: This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights. 
#1 Rs7-29: On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim —and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work. 
#1 Rs7-30: Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side. 
#1 Rs7-31: On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit "deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. "Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round. 
#1 Rs7-32: The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half. 
#1 Rs7-33: The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal. 
#1 Rs7-34: Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand. 
#1 Rs7-35: At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit "deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand. 
#1 Rs7-36: He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around. 
#1 Rs7-37: This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape. 
#1 Rs7-38: He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths "and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands. 
#1 Rs7-39: He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. 
#1 Rs7-40: He also made the pots "and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the LORD: 
#1 Rs7-41: the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; 
#1 Rs7-42: the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars); 
#1 Rs7-43: the ten stands with their ten basins; 
#1 Rs7-44: the Sea and the twelve bulls under it; 
#1 Rs7-45: the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of burnished bronze. 
#1 Rs7-46: The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan. 
#1 Rs7-47: Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined. 
#1 Rs7-48: Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the LORD's temple: the golden altar; the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence; 
#1 Rs7-49: the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work and lamps and tongs; 
#1 Rs7-50: the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple. 
#1 Rs7-51: When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated —the silver and gold and the furnishings —and he placed them in the treasuries of the LORD's temple.
 1 REIS 8
#1 Rs8-1: Then King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the LORD's covenant from Zion, the City of David. 
#1 Rs8-2: All the Israelites came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month. 
#1 Rs8-3: When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark, 
#1 Rs8-4: and they brought up the ark of the LORD and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up, 
#1 Rs8-5: and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted. 
#1 Rs8-6: The priests then brought the ark of the LORD's covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. 
#1 Rs8-7: The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles. 
#1 Rs8-8: These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today. 
#1 Rs8-9: There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. 
#1 Rs8-10: When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the LORD. 
#1 Rs8-11: And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled his temple. 
#1 Rs8-12: Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud; 
#1 Rs8-13: I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever." 
#1 Rs8-14: While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them. 
#1 Rs8-15: Then he said: "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said, 
#1 Rs8-16: 'Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.' 
#1 Rs8-17: "My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
#1 Rs8-18: But the LORD said to my father David, 'You did well to have it in your heart to build a temple for my Name. 
#1 Rs8-19: Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood —he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.' 
#1 Rs8-20: "The LORD has kept the promise he made: I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
#1 Rs8-21: I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt." 
#1 Rs8-22: Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven 
#1 Rs8-23: and said: "LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below —you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way. 
#1 Rs8-24: You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it —as it is today. 
#1 Rs8-25: "Now LORD, the God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, 'You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before me faithfully as you have done.' 
#1 Rs8-26: And now, God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true. 
#1 Rs8-27: "But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built! 
#1 Rs8-28: Yet give attention to your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy, LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day. 
#1 Rs8-29: May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, this place of which you said, 'My Name shall be there,' so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place. 
#1 Rs8-30: Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive. 
#1 Rs8-31: "When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple, 
#1 Rs8-32: then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing down on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence. 
#1 Rs8-33: "When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you, and when they turn back to you and give praise to your name, praying and making supplication to you in this temple, 
#1 Rs8-34: then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors. 
#1 Rs8-35: "When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them, 
#1 Rs8-36: then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance. 
#1 Rs8-37: "When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when an enemy besieges them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come, 
#1 Rs8-38: and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel —being aware of the afflictions of their own hearts, and spreading out their hands toward this temple — 
#1 Rs8-39: then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know every human heart), 
#1 Rs8-40: so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors. 
#1 Rs8-41: "As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name — 
#1 Rs8-42: for they will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm —when they come and pray toward this temple, 
#1 Rs8-43: then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name. 
#1 Rs8-44: "When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to the LORD toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name, 
#1 Rs8-45: then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause. 
#1 Rs8-46: "When they sin against you —for there is no one who does not sin —and you become angry with them and give them over to their enemies, who take them captive to their own lands, far away or near; 
#1 Rs8-47: and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors and say, 'We have sinned, we have done wrong, we have acted wickedly'; 
#1 Rs8-48: and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name; 
#1 Rs8-49: then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause. 
#1 Rs8-50: And forgive your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses they have committed against you, and cause their captors to show them mercy; 
#1 Rs8-51: for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace. 
#1 Rs8-52: "May your eyes be open to your servant's plea and to the plea of your people Israel, and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you. 
#1 Rs8-53: For you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance, just as you declared through your servant Moses when you, Sovereign LORD, brought our ancestors out of Egypt." 
#1 Rs8-54: When Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the LORD, he rose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven. 
#1 Rs8-55: He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying: 
#1 Rs8-56: "Praise be to the LORD, who has given rest to his people Israel just as he promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave through his servant Moses. 
#1 Rs8-57: May the LORD our God be with us as he was with our ancestors; may he never leave us nor forsake us. 
#1 Rs8-58: May he turn our hearts to him, to walk in obedience to him and keep the commands, decrees and laws he gave our ancestors. 
#1 Rs8-59: And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel according to each day's need, 
#1 Rs8-60: so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is no other. 
#1 Rs8-61: And may your hearts be fully committed to the LORD our God, to live by his decrees and obey his commands, as at this time." 
#1 Rs8-62: Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD. 
#1 Rs8-63: Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the LORD: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD. 
#1 Rs8-64: On that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar that stood before the LORD was too small to hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings. 
#1 Rs8-65: So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him —a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the LORD our God for seven days and seven days more, fourteen days in all. 
#1 Rs8-66: On the following day he sent the people away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the LORD had done for his servant David and his people Israel.
 1 REIS 9
#1 Rs9-1: When Solomon had finished building the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do, 
#1 Rs9-2: the LORD appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. 
#1 Rs9-3: The LORD said to him: "I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there. 
#1 Rs9-4: "As for you, if you walk before me faithfully with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws, 
#1 Rs9-5: I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, 'You shall never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.' 
#1 Rs9-6: "But if you "or your descendants turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you "and go off to serve other gods and worship them, 
#1 Rs9-7: then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. 
#1 Rs9-8: This temple will become a heap of rubble. All "who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?' 
#1 Rs9-9: People will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them —that is why the LORD brought all this disaster on them.'" 
#1 Rs9-10: At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings —the temple of the LORD and the royal palace — 
#1 Rs9-11: King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and juniper and gold he wanted. 
#1 Rs9-12: But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them. 
#1 Rs9-13: "What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?" he asked. And he called them the Land of Kabul, "a name they have to this day. 
#1 Rs9-14: Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents "of gold. 
#1 Rs9-15: Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD's temple, his own palace, the terraces, "the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. 
#1 Rs9-16: (Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon's wife. 
#1 Rs9-17: And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon, 
#1 Rs9-18: Baalath, and Tadmor "in the desert, within his land, 
#1 Rs9-19: as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses "—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled. 
#1 Rs9-20: There were still people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites). 
#1 Rs9-21: Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these peoples remaining in the land —whom the Israelites could not exterminate "—to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day. 
#1 Rs9-22: But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers. 
#1 Rs9-23: They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon's projects —550 officials supervising those who did the work.

#1 Rs10-3: Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her. 
#1 Rs10-4: When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built, 
#1 Rs10-5: the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he made at "the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed. 
#1 Rs10-6: She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. 
#1 Rs10-7: But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard. 
#1 Rs10-8: How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! 
#1 Rs10-9: Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD's eternal love for Israel, he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness." 
#1 Rs10-10: And she gave the king 120 talents "of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

#1 Rs10-12: The king used the almugwood to make supports "for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. So much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day.)

#1 Rs10-21: All King Solomon's goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon's days.

#1 Rs11-2: They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, "You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods." Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. 
#1 Rs11-3: He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. 
#1 Rs11-4: As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 
#1 Rs11-5: He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites. 
#1 Rs11-6: So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done. 
#1 Rs11-7: On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites. 
#1 Rs11-8: He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods. 
#1 Rs11-9: The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 
#1 Rs11-10: Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD's command. 
#1 Rs11-11: So the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates. 
#1 Rs11-12: Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 
#1 Rs11-13: Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen." 
#1 Rs11-14: Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom. 
#1 Rs11-15: Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom. 
#1 Rs11-16: Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom. 
#1 Rs11-17: But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father. 
#1 Rs11-18: They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking people from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food. 
#1 Rs11-19: Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage. 
#1 Rs11-20: The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh's own children. 
#1 Rs11-21: While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me go, that I may return to my own country." 
#1 Rs11-22: "What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?" Pharaoh asked. "Nothing," Hadad replied, "but do let me go!" 
#1 Rs11-23: And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah. 
#1 Rs11-24: When David destroyed Zobah's army, Rezon gathered a band of men around him and became their leader; they went to Damascus, where they settled and took control. 
#1 Rs11-25: Rezon was Israel's adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel. 
#1 Rs11-26: Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon's officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah. 
#1 Rs11-27: Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the terraces "and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father. 
#1 Rs11-28: Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the tribes of Joseph. 
#1 Rs11-29: About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country, 
#1 Rs11-30: and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. 
#1 Rs11-31: Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes. 
#1 Rs11-32: But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe. 
#1 Rs11-33: I will do this because they have "forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Molek the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in obedience to me, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my decrees and laws as David, Solomon's father, did. 
#1 Rs11-34: "'But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon's hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees. 
#1 Rs11-35: I will take the kingdom from his son's hands and give you ten tribes. 
#1 Rs11-36: I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name. 
#1 Rs11-37: However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel. 
#1 Rs11-38: If you do whatever I command you and walk in obedience to me and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my decrees and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you. 
#1 Rs11-39: I will humble David's descendants because of this, but not forever.'" 
#1 Rs11-40: Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon's death. 
#1 Rs11-41: As for the other events of Solomon's reign —all he did and the wisdom he displayed —are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon? 
#1 Rs11-42: Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
#1 Rs11-43: Then he rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
 1 REIS 12
#1 Rs12-1: Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. 
#1 Rs12-2: When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from "Egypt. 
#1 Rs12-3: So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him: 
#1 Rs12-4: "Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you." 
#1 Rs12-5: Rehoboam answered, "Go away for three days and then come back to me." So the people went away. 
#1 Rs12-6: Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked. 
#1 Rs12-7: They replied, "If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants." 
#1 Rs12-8: But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 
#1 Rs12-9: He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?" 
#1 Rs12-10: The young men who had grown up with him replied, "These people have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.' Now tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. 
#1 Rs12-11: My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'" 
#1 Rs12-12: Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days." 
#1 Rs12-13: The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders, 
#1 Rs12-14: he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions." 
#1 Rs12-15: So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. 
#1 Rs12-16: When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, Israel! Look after your own house, David!" So the Israelites went home. 
#1 Rs12-17: But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them. 
#1 Rs12-18: King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, "who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. 
#1 Rs12-19: So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. 
#1 Rs12-20: When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David. 
#1 Rs12-21: When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered all Judah and the tribe of Benjamin —a hundred and eighty thousand able young men —to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon. 
#1 Rs12-22: But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: 
#1 Rs12-23: "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to all Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, 
#1 Rs12-24: 'This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the word of the LORD and went home again, as the LORD had ordered. 
#1 Rs12-25: Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel. [^3] 
#1 Rs12-26: Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. 
#1 Rs12-27: If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam." 
#1 Rs12-28: After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." 
#1 Rs12-29: One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan. 
#1 Rs12-30: And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other. [^4] 
#1 Rs12-31: Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites. 
#1 Rs12-32: He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made. 
#1 Rs12-33: On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.
 1 REIS 13
#1 Rs13-1: By the word of the LORD a man of God came from Judah to Bethel, as Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering. 
#1 Rs13-2: By the word of the LORD he cried out against the altar: "Altar, altar! This is what the LORD says: 'A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who make offerings here, and human bones will be burned on you.'" 
#1 Rs13-3: That same day the man of God gave a sign: "This is the sign the LORD has declared: The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out." 
#1 Rs13-4: When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, "Seize him!" But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back. 
#1 Rs13-5: Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the LORD. 
#1 Rs13-6: Then the king said to the man of God, "Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored." So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king's hand was restored and became as it was before. 
#1 Rs13-7: The king said to the man of God, "Come home with me for a meal, and I will give you a gift." 
#1 Rs13-8: But the man of God answered the king, "Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here. 
#1 Rs13-9: For I was commanded by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.'" 
#1 Rs13-10: So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel. 
#1 Rs13-11: Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king. 
#1 Rs13-12: Their father asked them, "Which way did he go?" And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken. 
#1 Rs13-13: So he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it 
#1 Rs13-14: and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" "I am," he replied. 
#1 Rs13-15: So the prophet said to him, "Come home with me and eat." 
#1 Rs13-16: The man of God said, "I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 
#1 Rs13-17: I have been told by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.'" 
#1 Rs13-18: The old prophet answered, "I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the LORD: 'Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.'" (But he was lying to him.) 
#1 Rs13-19: So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house. 
#1 Rs13-20: While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the old prophet who had brought him back. 
#1 Rs13-21: He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, "This is what the LORD says: 'You have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you. 
#1 Rs13-22: You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your ancestors.'" 
#1 Rs13-23: When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him. 
#1 Rs13-24: As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it. 
#1 Rs13-25: Some people who passed by saw the body lying there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived. 
#1 Rs13-26: When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, "It is the man of God who defied the word of the LORD. The LORD has given him over to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, as the word of the LORD had warned him." 
#1 Rs13-27: The prophet said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me," and they did so. 
#1 Rs13-28: Then he went out and found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey. 
#1 Rs13-29: So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him. 
#1 Rs13-30: Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, "Alas, my brother!" 
#1 Rs13-31: After burying him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. 
#1 Rs13-32: For the message he declared by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true." 
#1 Rs13-33: Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places. 
#1 Rs13-34: This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth.
 1 REIS 14
#1 Rs14-1: At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, 
#1 Rs14-2: and Jeroboam said to his wife, "Go, disguise yourself, so you won't be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there —the one who told me I would be king over this people. 
#1 Rs14-3: Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy." 
#1 Rs14-4: So Jeroboam's wife did what he said and went to Ahijah's house in Shiloh. Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age. 
#1 Rs14-5: But the LORD had told Ahijah, "Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else." 
#1 Rs14-6: So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news. 
#1 Rs14-7: Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. 
#1 Rs14-8: I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. 
#1 Rs14-9: You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have aroused my anger and turned your back on me. 
#1 Rs14-10: "'Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel —slave or free. "I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung, until it is all gone. 
#1 Rs14-11: Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country. The LORD has spoken!' 
#1 Rs14-12: "As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die. 
#1 Rs14-13: All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the LORD, the God of Israel, has found anything good. 
#1 Rs14-14: "The LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. Even now this is beginning to happen. [^2] 
#1 Rs14-15: And the LORD will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they aroused the LORD's anger by making Asherah poles. [^3] 
#1 Rs14-16: And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit." 
#1 Rs14-17: Then Jeroboam's wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died. 
#1 Rs14-18: They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the LORD had said through his servant the prophet Ahijah. 
#1 Rs14-19: The other events of Jeroboam's reign, his wars and how he ruled, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel. 
#1 Rs14-20: He reigned for twenty-two years and then rested with his ancestors. And Nadab his son succeeded him as king. 
#1 Rs14-21: Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. 
#1 Rs14-22: Judah did evil in the eyes of the LORD. By the sins they committed they stirred up his jealous anger more than those who were before them had done. 
#1 Rs14-23: They also set up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. 
#1 Rs14-24: There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. 
#1 Rs14-25: In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. 
#1 Rs14-26: He carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made. 
#1 Rs14-27: So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. 
#1 Rs14-28: Whenever the king went to the LORD's temple, the guards bore the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom. 
#1 Rs14-29: As for the other events of Rehoboam's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
#1 Rs14-30: There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 
#1 Rs14-31: And Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. And Abijah "his son succeeded him as king.
 1 REIS 15
#1 Rs15-1: In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijah "became king of Judah, 
#1 Rs15-2: and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother's name was Maakah daughter of Abishalom. [^2] 
#1 Rs15-3: He committed all the sins his father had done before him; his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his forefather had been. 
#1 Rs15-4: Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and by making Jerusalem strong.

#1 Rs15-19: "Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."

#1 Rs16-2: "I lifted you up from the dust and appointed you ruler over my people Israel, but you followed the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to arouse my anger by their sins. 
#1 Rs16-3: So I am about to wipe out Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat.

#1 Rs16-18: When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died,

#1 Rs17-1: Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe "in Gilead, said to Ahab, "As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word." 
#1 Rs17-2: Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah: 
#1 Rs17-3: "Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan. 
#1 Rs17-4: You will drink from the brook, and I have directed the ravens to supply you with food there." 
#1 Rs17-5: So he did what the LORD had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there. 
#1 Rs17-6: The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook. 
#1 Rs17-7: Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land. 
#1 Rs17-8: Then the word of the LORD came to him: 
#1 Rs17-9: "Go at once to Zarephath in the region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow there to supply you with food." 
#1 Rs17-10: So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, "Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?" 
#1 Rs17-11: As she was going to get it, he called, "And bring me, please, a piece of bread." 
#1 Rs17-12: "As surely as the LORD your God lives," she replied, "I don't have any bread —only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it —and die." 
#1 Rs17-13: Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son. 
#1 Rs17-14: For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD sends rain on the land.'" 
#1 Rs17-15: She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family. 
#1 Rs17-16: For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the LORD spoken by Elijah. 
#1 Rs17-17: Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing. 
#1 Rs17-18: She said to Elijah, "What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?" 
#1 Rs17-19: "Give me your son," Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed. 
#1 Rs17-20: Then he cried out to the LORD, "LORD my God, have you brought tragedy even on this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?" 
#1 Rs17-21: Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the LORD, "LORD my God, let this boy's life return to him!" 
#1 Rs17-22: The LORD heard Elijah's cry, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived. 
#1 Rs17-23: Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, "Look, your son is alive!" 
#1 Rs17-24: Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth."
 1 REIS 18
#1 Rs18-1: After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: "Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land." 
#1 Rs18-2: So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria, 
#1 Rs18-3: and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, his palace administrator. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD. 
#1 Rs18-4: While Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) 
#1 Rs18-5: Ahab had said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals." 
#1 Rs18-6: So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another. 
#1 Rs18-7: As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?" 
#1 Rs18-8: "Yes," he replied. "Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'" 
#1 Rs18-9: "What have I done wrong," asked Obadiah, "that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? 
#1 Rs18-10: As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you. 
#1 Rs18-11: But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' 
#1 Rs18-12: I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth. 
#1 Rs18-13: Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water. 
#1 Rs18-14: And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!" 
#1 Rs18-15: Elijah said, "As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today." 
#1 Rs18-16: So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
#1 Rs18-17: When he saw Elijah, he said to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?" 
#1 Rs18-18: "I have not made trouble for Israel," Elijah replied. "But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD's commands and have followed the Baals. 
#1 Rs18-19: Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table." 
#1 Rs18-20: So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. 
#1 Rs18-21: Elijah went before the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." But the people said nothing. 
#1 Rs18-22: Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. 
#1 Rs18-23: Get two bulls for us. Let Baal's prophets choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. 
#1 Rs18-24: Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire —he is God." Then all the people said, "What you say is good." 
#1 Rs18-25: Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire." 
#1 Rs18-26: So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. "Baal, answer us!" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made. 
#1 Rs18-27: At noon Elijah began to taunt them. "Shout louder!" he said. "Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened." 
#1 Rs18-28: So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. 
#1 Rs18-29: Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention. 
#1 Rs18-30: Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come here to me." They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which had been torn down. 
#1 Rs18-31: Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Your name shall be Israel." 
#1 Rs18-32: With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs "of seed. 
#1 Rs18-33: He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, "Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood." 
#1 Rs18-34: "Do it again," he said, and they did it again. "Do it a third time," he ordered, and they did it the third time. 
#1 Rs18-35: The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. 
#1 Rs18-36: At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: "LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. 
#1 Rs18-37: Answer me, LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again." 
#1 Rs18-38: Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench. 
#1 Rs18-39: When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, "The LORD —he is God! The LORD —he is God!" 
#1 Rs18-40: Then Elijah commanded them, "Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there. 
#1 Rs18-41: And Elijah said to Ahab, "Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain." 
#1 Rs18-42: So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. 
#1 Rs18-43: "Go and look toward the sea," he told his servant. And he went up and looked. "There is nothing there," he said. Seven times Elijah said, "Go back." 
#1 Rs18-44: The seventh time the servant reported, "A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'" 
#1 Rs18-45: Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain started falling and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. 
#1 Rs18-46: The power of the LORD came on Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
 1 REIS 19
#1 Rs19-1: Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 
#1 Rs19-2: So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them." 
#1 Rs19-3: Elijah was afraid "and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, 
#1 Rs19-4: while he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness. He came to a broom bush, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. "I have had enough, LORD," he said. "Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors." 
#1 Rs19-5: Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, "Get up and eat." 
#1 Rs19-6: He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again. 
#1 Rs19-7: The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, "Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you." 
#1 Rs19-8: So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. 
#1 Rs19-9: There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him: "What are you doing here, Elijah?" 
#1 Rs19-10: He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too." 
#1 Rs19-11: The LORD said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by." Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. 
#1 Rs19-12: After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. 
#1 Rs19-13: When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" 
#1 Rs19-14: He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too." 
#1 Rs19-15: The LORD said to him, "Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram. 
#1 Rs19-16: Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. 
#1 Rs19-17: Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu. 
#1 Rs19-18: Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel —all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him." 
#1 Rs19-19: So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. 
#1 Rs19-20: Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. "Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye," he said, "and then I will come with you." "Go back," Elijah replied. "What have I done to you?" 
#1 Rs19-21: So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant.
 1 REIS 20
#1 Rs20-1: Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it. 
#1 Rs20-2: He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying, "This is what Ben-Hadad says: 
#1 Rs20-3: 'Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine.'" 
#1 Rs20-4: The king of Israel answered, "Just as you say, my lord the king. I and all I have are yours." 
#1 Rs20-5: The messengers came again and said, "This is what Ben-Hadad says: 'I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and your children. 
#1 Rs20-6: But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away.'" 
#1 Rs20-7: The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, "See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him." 
#1 Rs20-8: The elders and the people all answered, "Don't listen to him or agree to his demands." 
#1 Rs20-9: So he replied to Ben-Hadad's messengers, "Tell my lord the king, 'Your servant will do all you demanded the first time, but this demand I cannot meet.'" They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad. 
#1 Rs20-10: Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful." 
#1 Rs20-11: The king of Israel answered, "Tell him: 'One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off.'" 
#1 Rs20-12: Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, "and he ordered his men: "Prepare to attack." So they prepared to attack the city. 
#1 Rs20-13: Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced, "This is what the LORD says: 'Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am the LORD.'" 
#1 Rs20-14: "But who will do this?" asked Ahab. The prophet replied, "This is what the LORD says: 'The junior officers under the provincial commanders will do it.'" "And who will start the battle?" he asked. The prophet answered, "You will." 
#1 Rs20-15: So Ahab summoned the 232 junior officers under the provincial commanders. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all. 
#1 Rs20-16: They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk. 
#1 Rs20-17: The junior officers under the provincial commanders went out first. Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts, who reported, "Men are advancing from Samaria." 
#1 Rs20-18: He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive." 
#1 Rs20-19: The junior officers under the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them 
#1 Rs20-20: and each one struck down his opponent. At that, the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen. 
#1 Rs20-21: The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans. 
#1 Rs20-22: Afterward, the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, "Strengthen your position and see what must be done, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again." 
#1 Rs20-23: Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, "Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they. 
#1 Rs20-24: Do this: Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers. 
#1 Rs20-25: You must also raise an army like the one you lost —horse for horse and chariot for chariot —so we can fight Israel on the plains. Then surely we will be stronger than they." He agreed with them and acted accordingly. 
#1 Rs20-26: The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. 
#1 Rs20-27: When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions, they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside. 
#1 Rs20-28: The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because the Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the LORD.'" 
#1 Rs20-29: For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day. 
#1 Rs20-30: The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them. And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room. 
#1 Rs20-31: His officials said to him, "Look, we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. Let us go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life." 
#1 Rs20-32: Wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-Hadad says: 'Please let me live.'" The king answered, "Is he still alive? He is my brother." 
#1 Rs20-33: The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word. "Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad!" they said. "Go and get him," the king said. When Ben-Hadad came out, Ahab had him come up into his chariot. 
#1 Rs20-34: "I will return the cities my father took from your father," Ben-Hadad offered. "You may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." Ahab said, "On the basis of a treaty I will set you free." So he made a treaty with him, and let him go. 
#1 Rs20-35: By the word of the LORD one of the company of the prophets said to his companion, "Strike me with your weapon," but he refused. 
#1 Rs20-36: So the prophet said, "Because you have not obeyed the LORD, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you." And after the man went away, a lion found him and killed him. 
#1 Rs20-37: The prophet found another man and said, "Strike me, please." So the man struck him and wounded him. 
#1 Rs20-38: Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king. He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes. 
#1 Rs20-39: As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, "Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, 'Guard this man. If he is missing, it will be your life for his life, or you must pay a talent "of silver.' 
#1 Rs20-40: While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared." "That is your sentence," the king of Israel said. "You have pronounced it yourself." 
#1 Rs20-41: Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. 
#1 Rs20-42: He said to the king, "This is what the LORD says: 'You have set free a man I had determined should die. "Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.'" 
#1 Rs20-43: Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went to his palace in Samaria.
 1 REIS 21
#1 Rs21-1: Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel, close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
#1 Rs21-2: Ahab said to Naboth, "Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth." 
#1 Rs21-3: But Naboth replied, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors." 
#1 Rs21-4: So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors." He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat. 
#1 Rs21-5: His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, "Why are you so sullen? Why won't you eat?" 
#1 Rs21-6: He answered her, "Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'" 
#1 Rs21-7: Jezebel his wife said, "Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I'll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite." 
#1 Rs21-8: So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city with him. 
#1 Rs21-9: In those letters she wrote: "Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people. 
#1 Rs21-10: But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them bring charges that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death." 
#1 Rs21-11: So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them. 
#1 Rs21-12: They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people. 
#1 Rs21-13: Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, "Naboth has cursed both God and the king." So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death. 
#1 Rs21-14: Then they sent word to Jezebel: "Naboth has been stoned to death." 
#1 Rs21-15: As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, "Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead." 
#1 Rs21-16: When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth's vineyard. 
#1 Rs21-17: Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite: 
#1 Rs21-18: "Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. 
#1 Rs21-19: Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?' Then say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up your blood —yes, yours!'" 
#1 Rs21-20: Ahab said to Elijah, "So you have found me, my enemy!" "I have found you," he answered, "because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD. 
#1 Rs21-21: He says, 'I am going to bring disaster on you. I will wipe out your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel —slave or free. [^1] 
#1 Rs21-22: I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have aroused my anger and have caused Israel to sin.' 
#1 Rs21-23: "And also concerning Jezebel the LORD says: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of "Jezreel.' 
#1 Rs21-24: "Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country." 
#1 Rs21-25: (There was never anyone like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, urged on by Jezebel his wife. 
#1 Rs21-26: He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the LORD drove out before Israel.) 
#1 Rs21-27: When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly. 
#1 Rs21-28: Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite: 
#1 Rs21-29: "Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son."
 1 REIS 22
#1 Rs22-1: For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel. 
#1 Rs22-2: But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel. 
#1 Rs22-3: The king of Israel had said to his officials, "Don't you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?" 
#1 Rs22-4: So he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses." 
#1 Rs22-5: But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD." 
#1 Rs22-6: So the king of Israel brought together the prophets —about four hundred men —and asked them, "Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for the Lord will give it into the king's hand." 
#1 Rs22-7: But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no longer a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?" 
#1 Rs22-8: The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say such a thing," Jehoshaphat replied. 
#1 Rs22-9: So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once." 
#1 Rs22-10: Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
#1 Rs22-11: Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, "This is what the LORD says: 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'" 
#1 Rs22-12: All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand." 
#1 Rs22-13: The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably." 
#1 Rs22-14: But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what the LORD tells me." 
#1 Rs22-15: When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or not?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand." 
#1 Rs22-16: The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?" 
#1 Rs22-17: Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'" 
#1 Rs22-18: The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?" 
#1 Rs22-19: Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left. 
#1 Rs22-20: And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that. 
#1 Rs22-21: Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.' 
#1 Rs22-22: "'By what means?' the LORD asked. "'I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.' 
#1 Rs22-23: "So now the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you." 
#1 Rs22-24: Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from "the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked. 
#1 Rs22-25: Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room." 
#1 Rs22-26: The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son 
#1 Rs22-27: and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'" 
#1 Rs22-28: Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!" 
#1 Rs22-29: So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
#1 Rs22-30: The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. 
#1 Rs22-31: Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel." 
#1 Rs22-32: When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out, 
#1 Rs22-33: the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him. 
#1 Rs22-34: But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded." 
#1 Rs22-35: All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died. 
#1 Rs22-36: As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: "Every man to his town. Every man to his land!" 
#1 Rs22-37: So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there. 
#1 Rs22-38: They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), "and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the LORD had declared. 
#1 Rs22-39: As for the other events of Ahab's reign, including all he did, the palace he built and adorned with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
#1 Rs22-40: Ahab rested with his ancestors. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king. 
#1 Rs22-41: Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
#1 Rs22-42: Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
#1 Rs22-43: In everything he followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. The high places, however, were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. [^3] 
#1 Rs22-44: Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel. 
#1 Rs22-45: As for the other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
#1 Rs22-46: He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. 
#1 Rs22-47: There was then no king in Edom; a provincial governor ruled. 
#1 Rs22-48: Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships "to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail —they were wrecked at Ezion Geber. 
#1 Rs22-49: At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men sail with yours," but Jehoshaphat refused. 
#1 Rs22-50: Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king. 
#1 Rs22-51: Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 
#1 Rs22-52: He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, because he followed the ways of his father and mother and of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. 
#1 Rs22-53: He served and worshiped Baal and aroused the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, just as his father had done.
2 REIS
 2 REIS 1
#2 Rs1-1: After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel. 
#2 Rs1-2: Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury." 
#2 Rs1-3: But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?' 
#2 Rs1-4: Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'" So Elijah went. 
#2 Rs1-5: When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you come back?" 
#2 Rs1-6: "A man came to meet us," they replied. "And he said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"'" 
#2 Rs1-7: The king asked them, "What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?" 
#2 Rs1-8: They replied, "He had a garment of hair "and had a leather belt around his waist." The king said, "That was Elijah the Tishbite." 
#2 Rs1-9: Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God, the king says, 'Come down!'" 
#2 Rs1-10: Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men. 
#2 Rs1-11: At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, "Man of God, this is what the king says, 'Come down at once!'" 
#2 Rs1-12: "If I am a man of God," Elijah replied, "may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men. 
#2 Rs1-13: So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man of God," he begged, "please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants! 
#2 Rs1-14: See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!" 
#2 Rs1-15: The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king. 
#2 Rs1-16: He told the king, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!" 
#2 Rs1-17: So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram "succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. 
#2 Rs1-18: As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
 2 REIS 2
#2 Rs2-1: When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. 
#2 Rs2-2: Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel. 
#2 Rs2-3: The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," Elisha replied, "so be quiet." 
#2 Rs2-4: Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here, Elisha; the LORD has sent me to Jericho." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho. 
#2 Rs2-5: The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," he replied, "so be quiet." 
#2 Rs2-6: Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two of them walked on. 
#2 Rs2-7: Fifty men from the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan. 
#2 Rs2-8: Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground. 
#2 Rs2-9: When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?" "Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit," Elisha replied. 
#2 Rs2-10: "You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah said, "yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours —otherwise, it will not." 
#2 Rs2-11: As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. 
#2 Rs2-12: Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his garment and tore it in two. 
#2 Rs2-13: Elisha then picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
#2 Rs2-14: He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and struck the water with it. "Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over. 
#2 Rs2-15: The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, "The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him. 
#2 Rs2-16: "Look," they said, "we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley." "No," Elisha replied, "do not send them." 
#2 Rs2-17: But they persisted until he was too embarrassed to refuse. So he said, "Send them." And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him. 
#2 Rs2-18: When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?" 
#2 Rs2-19: The people of the city said to Elisha, "Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive." 
#2 Rs2-20: "Bring me a new bowl," he said, "and put salt in it." So they brought it to him. 
#2 Rs2-21: Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, "This is what the LORD says: 'I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.'" 
#2 Rs2-22: And the water has remained pure to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken. 
#2 Rs2-23: From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. "Get out of here, baldy!" they said. "Get out of here, baldy!" 
#2 Rs2-24: He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys. 
#2 Rs2-25: And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.
 2 REIS 3
#2 Rs3-1: Joram "son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years. 
#2 Rs3-2: He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made. 
#2 Rs3-3: Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them. 
#2 Rs3-4: Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to pay the king of Israel a tribute of a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams. 
#2 Rs3-5: But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
#2 Rs3-6: So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel. 
#2 Rs3-7: He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?" "I will go with you," he replied. "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses." 
#2 Rs3-8: "By what route shall we attack?" he asked. "Through the Desert of Edom," he answered. 
#2 Rs3-9: So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them. 
#2 Rs3-10: "What!" exclaimed the king of Israel. "Has the LORD called us three kings together only to deliver us into the hands of Moab?" 
#2 Rs3-11: But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?" An officer of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah. "" 
#2 Rs3-12: Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. 
#2 Rs3-13: Elisha said to the king of Israel, "Why do you want to involve me? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother." "No," the king of Israel answered, "because it was the LORD who called us three kings together to deliver us into the hands of Moab." 
#2 Rs3-14: Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not pay any attention to you. 
#2 Rs3-15: But now bring me a harpist." While the harpist was playing, the hand of the LORD came on Elisha 
#2 Rs3-16: and he said, "This is what the LORD says: I will fill this valley with pools of water. 
#2 Rs3-17: For this is what the LORD says: You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink. 
#2 Rs3-18: This is an easy thing in the eyes of the LORD; he will also deliver Moab into your hands. 
#2 Rs3-19: You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones." 
#2 Rs3-20: The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was —water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water. 
#2 Rs3-21: Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border. 
#2 Rs3-22: When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red —like blood. 
#2 Rs3-23: "That's blood!" they said. "Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!" 
#2 Rs3-24: But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites. 
#2 Rs3-25: They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it. 
#2 Rs3-26: When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed. 
#2 Rs3-27: Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.
 2 REIS 4
#2 Rs4-1: The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the LORD. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves." 
#2 Rs4-2: Elisha replied to her, "How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?Your servant has nothing there at all," she said, "except a little oil." 
#2 Rs4-3: Elisha said, "Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask for just a few. 
#2 Rs4-4: Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side." 
#2 Rs4-5: She left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring. 
#2 Rs4-6: When all the jars were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another one." But he replied, "There is not a jar left." Then the oil stopped flowing. 
#2 Rs4-7: She went and told the man of God, and he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left." 
#2 Rs4-8: One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat. 
#2 Rs4-9: She said to her husband, "I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God. 
#2 Rs4-10: Let's make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us." 
#2 Rs4-11: One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there. 
#2 Rs4-12: He said to his servant Gehazi, "Call the Shunammite." So he called her, and she stood before him. 
#2 Rs4-13: Elisha said to him, "Tell her, 'You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?'" She replied, "I have a home among my own people." 
#2 Rs4-14: "What can be done for her?" Elisha asked. Gehazi said, "Well, she has no son and her husband is old." 
#2 Rs4-15: Then Elisha said, "Call her." So he called her, and she stood in the doorway. 
#2 Rs4-16: "About this time next year," Elisha said, "you will hold a son in your arms.No, my lord," she objected. "Don't mislead your servant, O man of God!" 
#2 Rs4-17: But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her. 
#2 Rs4-18: The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers. 
#2 Rs4-19: "My head! My head!" he said to his father. His father told a servant, "Carry him to his mother." 
#2 Rs4-20: After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died. 
#2 Rs4-21: She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out. 
#2 Rs4-22: She called her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return." 
#2 Rs4-23: "Why go to him today?" he asked. "It's not the New Moon or the Sabbath.It's all right," she said. 
#2 Rs4-24: She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, "Lead on; don't slow down for me unless I tell you." 
#2 Rs4-25: So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, "Look! There's the Shunammite! 
#2 Rs4-26: Run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?' Everything is all right," she said. 
#2 Rs4-27: When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, "Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me why." 
#2 Rs4-28: "Did I ask you for a son, my lord?" she said. "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't raise my hopes'?" 
#2 Rs4-29: Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy's face." 
#2 Rs4-30: But the child's mother said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So he got up and followed her. 
#2 Rs4-31: Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, "The boy has not awakened." 
#2 Rs4-32: When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch. 
#2 Rs4-33: He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the LORD. 
#2 Rs4-34: Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy's body grew warm. 
#2 Rs4-35: Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. 
#2 Rs4-36: Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite." And he did. When she came, he said, "Take your son." 
#2 Rs4-37: She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out. 
#2 Rs4-38: Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, "Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men." 
#2 Rs4-39: One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were. 
#2 Rs4-40: The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat it. 
#2 Rs4-41: Elisha said, "Get some flour." He put it into the pot and said, "Serve it to the people to eat." And there was nothing harmful in the pot. 
#2 Rs4-42: A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. "Give it to the people to eat," Elisha said. 
#2 Rs4-43: "How can I set this before a hundred men?" his servant asked. But Elisha answered, "Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the LORD says: 'They will eat and have some left over.'" 
#2 Rs4-44: Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.
 2 REIS 5
#2 Rs5-1: Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy. [^1] 
#2 Rs5-2: Now bands of raiders from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman's wife. 
#2 Rs5-3: She said to her mistress, "If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy." 
#2 Rs5-4: Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said. 
#2 Rs5-5: "By all means, go," the king of Aram replied. "I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents "of silver, six thousand shekels "of gold and ten sets of clothing. 
#2 Rs5-6: The letter that he took to the king of Israel read: "With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy." 
#2 Rs5-7: As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, "Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!" 
#2 Rs5-8: When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message: "Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel." 
#2 Rs5-9: So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house. 
#2 Rs5-10: Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, "Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed." 
#2 Rs5-11: But Naaman went away angry and said, "I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy. 
#2 Rs5-12: Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?" So he turned and went off in a rage. 
#2 Rs5-13: Naaman's servants went to him and said, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'!" 
#2 Rs5-14: So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy. 
#2 Rs5-15: Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant." 
#2 Rs5-16: The prophet answered, "As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing." And even though Naaman urged him, he refused. 
#2 Rs5-17: "If you will not," said Naaman, "please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the LORD. 
#2 Rs5-18: But may the LORD forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I have to bow there also —when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant for this." 
#2 Rs5-19: "Go in peace," Elisha said. After Naaman had traveled some distance, 
#2 Rs5-20: Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, "My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him." 
#2 Rs5-21: So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. "Is everything all right?" he asked. 
#2 Rs5-22: "Everything is all right," Gehazi answered. "My master sent me to say, 'Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent "of silver and two sets of clothing.'" 
#2 Rs5-23: "By all means, take two talents," said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi. 
#2 Rs5-24: When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left. 
#2 Rs5-25: When he went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" "Your servant didn't go anywhere," Gehazi answered. 
#2 Rs5-26: But Elisha said to him, "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes —or olive groves and vineyards, or flocks and herds, or male and female slaves? 
#2 Rs5-27: Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever." Then Gehazi went from Elisha's presence and his skin was leprous —it had become as white as snow.
 2 REIS 6
#2 Rs6-1: The company of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us. 
#2 Rs6-2: Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to meet." And he said, "Go." 
#2 Rs6-3: Then one of them said, "Won't you please come with your servants?" "I will," Elisha replied. 
#2 Rs6-4: And he went with them. They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees. 
#2 Rs6-5: As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. "Oh no, my lord!" he cried out. "It was borrowed!" 
#2 Rs6-6: The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float. 
#2 Rs6-7: "Lift it out," he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it. 
#2 Rs6-8: Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, "I will set up my camp in such and such a place." 
#2 Rs6-9: The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: "Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there." 
#2 Rs6-10: So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places. 
#2 Rs6-11: This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, "Tell me! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?" 
#2 Rs6-12: "None of us, my lord the king," said one of his officers, "but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom." 
#2 Rs6-13: "Go, find out where he is," the king ordered, "so I can send men and capture him." The report came back: "He is in Dothan." 
#2 Rs6-14: Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city. 
#2 Rs6-15: When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. "Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?" the servant asked. 
#2 Rs6-16: "Don't be afraid," the prophet answered. "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them." 
#2 Rs6-17: And Elisha prayed, "Open his eyes, LORD, so that he may see." Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. 
#2 Rs6-18: As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, "Strike this army with blindness." So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked. 
#2 Rs6-19: Elisha told them, "This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for." And he led them to Samaria. 
#2 Rs6-20: After they entered the city, Elisha said, "LORD, open the eyes of these men so they can see." Then the LORD opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria. 
#2 Rs6-21: When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?" 
#2 Rs6-22: "Do not kill them," he answered. "Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master." 
#2 Rs6-23: So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory. 
#2 Rs6-24: Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria. 
#2 Rs6-25: There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey's head sold for eighty shekels "of silver, and a quarter of a cab "of seed pods "for five shekels. [^4] 
#2 Rs6-26: As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, "Help me, my lord the king!" 
#2 Rs6-27: The king replied, "If the LORD does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?" 
#2 Rs6-28: Then he asked her, "What's the matter?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.' 
#2 Rs6-29: So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Give up your son so we may eat him,' but she had hidden him." 
#2 Rs6-30: When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and they saw that, under his robes, he had sackcloth on his body. 
#2 Rs6-31: He said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!" 
#2 Rs6-32: Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Don't you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master's footsteps behind him?" 
#2 Rs6-33: While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him. The king said, "This disaster is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
 2 REIS 7
#2 Rs7-1: Elisha replied, "Hear the word of the LORD. This is what the LORD says: About this time tomorrow, a seah "of the finest flour will sell for a shekel "and two seahs "of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria." 
#2 Rs7-2: The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?" "You will see it with your own eyes," answered Elisha, "but you will not eat any of it!" 
#2 Rs7-3: Now there were four men with leprosy "at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, "Why stay here until we die? 
#2 Rs7-4: If we say, 'We'll go into the city' —the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let's go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die." 
#2 Rs7-5: At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, no one was there, 
#2 Rs7-6: for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!" 
#2 Rs7-7: So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives. 
#2 Rs7-8: The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp, entered one of the tents and ate and drank. Then they took silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also. 
#2 Rs7-9: Then they said to each other, "What we're doing is not right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let's go at once and report this to the royal palace." 
#2 Rs7-10: So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, "We went into the Aramean camp and no one was there —not a sound of anyone —only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were." 
#2 Rs7-11: The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace. 
#2 Rs7-12: The king got up in the night and said to his officers, "I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, 'They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.'" 
#2 Rs7-13: One of his officers answered, "Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here —yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened." 
#2 Rs7-14: So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, "Go and find out what has happened." 
#2 Rs7-15: They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king. 
#2 Rs7-16: Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of the finest flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the LORD had said. 
#2 Rs7-17: Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house. 
#2 Rs7-18: It happened as the man of God had said to the king: "About this time tomorrow, a seah of the finest flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria." 
#2 Rs7-19: The officer had said to the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?" The man of God had replied, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!" 
#2 Rs7-20: And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.
 2 REIS 8
#2 Rs8-1: Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, "Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the LORD has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years." 
#2 Rs8-2: The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years. 
#2 Rs8-3: At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and land. 
#2 Rs8-4: The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, "Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done." 
#2 Rs8-5: Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to appeal to the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, "This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life." 
#2 Rs8-6: The king asked the woman about it, and she told him. Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, "Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now." 
#2 Rs8-7: Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, "The man of God has come all the way up here," 
#2 Rs8-8: he said to Hazael, "Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the LORD through him; ask him, 'Will I recover from this illness?'" 
#2 Rs8-9: Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him, and said, "Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, 'Will I recover from this illness?'" 
#2 Rs8-10: Elisha answered, "Go and say to him, 'You will certainly recover.' Nevertheless, "the LORD has revealed to me that he will in fact die." 
#2 Rs8-11: He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael was embarrassed. Then the man of God began to weep. 
#2 Rs8-12: "Why is my lord weeping?" asked Hazael. "Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites," he answered. "You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women." 
#2 Rs8-13: Hazael said, "How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?" "The LORD has shown me that you will become king of Aram," answered Elisha. 
#2 Rs8-14: Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, "What did Elisha say to you?" Hazael replied, "He told me that you would certainly recover." 
#2 Rs8-15: But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king's face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king. 
#2 Rs8-16: In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah. 
#2 Rs8-17: He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
#2 Rs8-18: He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD. 
#2 Rs8-19: Nevertheless, for the sake of his servant David, the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah. He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever. 
#2 Rs8-20: In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king. 
#2 Rs8-21: So Jehoram "went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home. 
#2 Rs8-22: To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time. 
#2 Rs8-23: As for the other events of Jehoram's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
#2 Rs8-24: Jehoram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king. 
#2 Rs8-25: In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. 
#2 Rs8-26: Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. 
#2 Rs8-27: He followed the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to Ahab's family. 
#2 Rs8-28: Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram; 
#2 Rs8-29: so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth "in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab, because he had been wounded.
 2 REIS 9
#2 Rs9-1: The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of olive oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead. 
#2 Rs9-2: When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room. 
#2 Rs9-3: Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, 'This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and run; don't delay!" 
#2 Rs9-4: So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead. 
#2 Rs9-5: When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. "I have a message for you, commander," he said. "For which of us?" asked Jehu. "For you, commander," he replied. 
#2 Rs9-6: Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and declared, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I anoint you king over the LORD's people Israel. 
#2 Rs9-7: You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the LORD's servants shed by Jezebel. 
#2 Rs9-8: The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel —slave or free. [^1] 
#2 Rs9-9: I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah. 
#2 Rs9-10: As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.'" Then he opened the door and ran. 
#2 Rs9-11: When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, "Is everything all right? Why did this maniac come to you?" "You know the man and the sort of things he says," Jehu replied. 
#2 Rs9-12: "That's not true!" they said. "Tell us." Jehu said, "Here is what he told me: 'This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.'" 
#2 Rs9-13: They quickly took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, "Jehu is king!" 
#2 Rs9-14: So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram, 
#2 Rs9-15: but King Joram "had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, "If you desire to make me king, don't let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel." 
#2 Rs9-16: Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him. 
#2 Rs9-17: When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu's troops approaching, he called out, "I see some troops coming." "Get a horseman," Joram ordered. "Send him to meet them and ask, 'Do you come in peace?'" 
#2 Rs9-18: The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, "This is what the king says: 'Do you come in peace?'" "What do you have to do with peace?" Jehu replied. "Fall in behind me." The lookout reported, "The messenger has reached them, but he isn't coming back." 
#2 Rs9-19: So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, "This is what the king says: 'Do you come in peace?'" Jehu replied, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me." 
#2 Rs9-20: The lookout reported, "He has reached them, but he isn't coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi —he drives like a maniac." 
#2 Rs9-21: "Hitch up my chariot," Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. 
#2 Rs9-22: When Joram saw Jehu he asked, "Have you come in peace, Jehu?" "How can there be peace," Jehu replied, "as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?" 
#2 Rs9-23: Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, "Treachery, Ahaziah!" 
#2 Rs9-24: Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot. 
#2 Rs9-25: Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, "Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the LORD spoke this prophecy against him: 
#2 Rs9-26: 'Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the LORD, and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the LORD.' "Now then, pick him up and throw him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the LORD." 
#2 Rs9-27: When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan. "Jehu chased him, shouting, "Kill him too!" They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there. 
#2 Rs9-28: His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in the City of David. 
#2 Rs9-29: (In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.) 
#2 Rs9-30: Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she put on eye makeup, arranged her hair and looked out of a window. 
#2 Rs9-31: As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, "Have you come in peace, you Zimri, you murderer of your master?" [^5] 
#2 Rs9-32: He looked up at the window and called out, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked down at him. 
#2 Rs9-33: "Throw her down!" Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot. 
#2 Rs9-34: Jehu went in and ate and drank. "Take care of that cursed woman," he said, "and bury her, for she was a king's daughter." 
#2 Rs9-35: But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands. 
#2 Rs9-36: They went back and told Jehu, who said, "This is the word of the LORD that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh. [^6] 
#2 Rs9-37: Jezebel's body will be like dung on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, 'This is Jezebel.'"
 2 REIS 10
#2 Rs10-1: Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel, "to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab's children. He said, 
#2 Rs10-2: "You have your master's sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you, 
#2 Rs10-3: choose the best and most worthy of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne. Then fight for your master's house." 
#2 Rs10-4: But they were terrified and said, "If two kings could not resist him, how can we?" 
#2 Rs10-5: So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: "We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best." 
#2 Rs10-6: Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them. 
#2 Rs10-7: When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel. 
#2 Rs10-8: When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, "They have brought the heads of the princes." Then Jehu ordered, "Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning." 
#2 Rs10-9: The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? 
#2 Rs10-10: Know, then, that not a word the LORD has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The LORD has done what he announced through his servant Elijah." 
#2 Rs10-11: So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor. 
#2 Rs10-12: Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds, 
#2 Rs10-13: he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, "Who are you?" They said, "We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother." 
#2 Rs10-14: "Take them alive!" he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked —forty-two of them. He left no survivor. 
#2 Rs10-15: After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Rekab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, "Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?" "I am," Jehonadab answered. "If so," said Jehu, "give me your hand." So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot. 
#2 Rs10-16: Jehu said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD." Then he had him ride along in his chariot. 
#2 Rs10-17: When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab's family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD spoken to Elijah. 
#2 Rs10-18: Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much. 
#2 Rs10-19: Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live." But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal. 
#2 Rs10-20: Jehu said, "Call an assembly in honor of Baal." So they proclaimed it. 
#2 Rs10-21: Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other. 
#2 Rs10-22: And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, "Bring robes for all the servants of Baal." So he brought out robes for them. 
#2 Rs10-23: Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, "Look around and see that no one who serves the LORD is here with you —only servants of Baal." 
#2 Rs10-24: So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: "If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life." 
#2 Rs10-25: As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: "Go in and kill them; let no one escape." So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal. 
#2 Rs10-26: They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it. 
#2 Rs10-27: They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day. 
#2 Rs10-28: So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel. 
#2 Rs10-29: However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit —the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. 
#2 Rs10-30: The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation." 
#2 Rs10-31: Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit. 
#2 Rs10-32: In those days the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory 
#2 Rs10-33: east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan. 
#2 Rs10-34: As for the other events of Jehu's reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?

#2 Rs11-5: He commanded them, saying, "This is what you are to do: You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath —a third of you guarding the royal palace, 
#2 Rs11-6: a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guard, who take turns guarding the temple — 
#2 Rs11-7: and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king. 
#2 Rs11-8: Station yourselves around the king, each of you with weapon in hand. Anyone who approaches your ranks "is to be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes." 
#2 Rs11-9: The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men —those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty —and came to Jehoiada the priest.

#2 Rs11-14: She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out, "Treason! Treason!" 
#2 Rs11-15: Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops: "Bring her out between the ranks "and put to the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "She must not be put to death in the temple of the LORD."

#2 Rs12-6: But by the twenty-third year of King Joash the priests still had not repaired the temple. 
#2 Rs12-7: Therefore King Joash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them, "Why aren't you repairing the damage done to the temple? Take no more money from your treasurers, but hand it over for repairing the temple."

#2 Rs17-4: But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor, for he had sent envoys to So "king of Egypt, and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison. 
#2 Rs17-5: The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years. 
#2 Rs17-6: In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes. 
#2 Rs17-7: All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped other gods 
#2 Rs17-8: and followed the practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before them, as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced. 
#2 Rs17-9: The Israelites secretly did things against the LORD their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns. 
#2 Rs17-10: They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. 
#2 Rs17-11: At every high place they burned incense, as the nations whom the LORD had driven out before them had done. They did wicked things that aroused the LORD's anger. 
#2 Rs17-12: They worshiped idols, though the LORD had said, "You shall not do this." [^2] 
#2 Rs17-13: The LORD warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers: "Turn from your evil ways. Observe my commands and decrees, in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your ancestors to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets." 
#2 Rs17-14: But they would not listen and were as stiff-necked as their ancestors, who did not trust in the LORD their God. 
#2 Rs17-15: They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors and the statutes he had warned them to keep. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the nations around them although the LORD had ordered them, "Do not do as they do." 
#2 Rs17-16: They forsook all the commands of the LORD their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves, and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the starry hosts, and they worshiped Baal. 
#2 Rs17-17: They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced divination and sought omens and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, arousing his anger. 
#2 Rs17-18: So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left, 
#2 Rs17-19: and even Judah did not keep the commands of the LORD their God. They followed the practices Israel had introduced. 
#2 Rs17-20: Therefore the LORD rejected all the people of Israel; he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers, until he thrust them from his presence. 
#2 Rs17-21: When he tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit a great sin. 
#2 Rs17-22: The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them 
#2 Rs17-23: until the LORD removed them from his presence, as he had warned through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were taken from their homeland into exile in Assyria, and they are still there. 
#2 Rs17-24: The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Kuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its towns. 
#2 Rs17-25: When they first lived there, they did not worship the LORD; so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people. 
#2 Rs17-26: It was reported to the king of Assyria: "The people you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of that country requires. He has sent lions among them, which are killing them off, because the people do not know what he requires." 
#2 Rs17-27: Then the king of Assyria gave this order: "Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires." 
#2 Rs17-28: So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the LORD. 
#2 Rs17-29: Nevertheless, each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled, and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places. 
#2 Rs17-30: The people from Babylon made Sukkoth Benoth, those from Kuthah made Nergal, and those from Hamath made Ashima; 
#2 Rs17-31: the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelek and Anammelek, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
#2 Rs17-32: They worshiped the LORD, but they also appointed all sorts of their own people to officiate for them as priests in the shrines at the high places. 
#2 Rs17-33: They worshiped the LORD, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought. 
#2 Rs17-34: To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the LORD nor adhere to the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel. 
#2 Rs17-35: When the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites, he commanded them: "Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them, serve them or sacrifice to them. 
#2 Rs17-36: But the LORD, who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm, is the one you must worship. To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices. 
#2 Rs17-37: You must always be careful to keep the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods. 
#2 Rs17-38: Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods. 
#2 Rs17-39: Rather, worship the LORD your God; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies." 
#2 Rs17-40: They would not listen, however, but persisted in their former practices. 
#2 Rs17-41: Even while these people were worshiping the LORD, they were serving their idols. To this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their ancestors did.

#2 Rs18-6: He held fast to the LORD and did not stop following him; he kept the commands the LORD had given Moses. 
#2 Rs18-7: And the LORD was with him; he was successful in whatever he undertook. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.

#2 Rs18-11: The king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in towns of the Medes. 
#2 Rs18-12: This happened because they had not obeyed the LORD their God, but had violated his covenant —all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. They neither listened to the commands nor carried them out. 
#2 Rs18-13: In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
#2 Rs18-14: So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish: "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand of me." The king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents "of silver and thirty talents "of gold. 
#2 Rs18-15: So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace. 
#2 Rs18-16: At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the LORD, and gave it to the king of Assyria. 
#2 Rs18-17: The king of Assyria sent his supreme commander, his chief officer and his field commander with a large army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field. 
#2 Rs18-18: They called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to them. 
#2 Rs18-19: The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah: "'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? 
#2 Rs18-20: You say you have the counsel and the might for war —but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? 
#2 Rs18-21: Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. 
#2 Rs18-22: But if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God" —isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem"? 
#2 Rs18-23: "'Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses —if you can put riders on them! 
#2 Rs18-24: How can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen "? 
#2 Rs18-25: Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'" 
#2 Rs18-26: Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall." 
#2 Rs18-27: But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall —who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?" 
#2 Rs18-28: Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
#2 Rs18-29: This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand. 
#2 Rs18-30: Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, 'The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.' 
#2 Rs18-31: "Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern, 
#2 Rs18-32: until I come and take you to a land like your own —a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death! "Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, 'The LORD will deliver us.' 
#2 Rs18-33: Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 
#2 Rs18-34: Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand? 
#2 Rs18-35: Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?" 
#2 Rs18-36: But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him." 
#2 Rs18-37: Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.
 2 REIS 19
#2 Rs19-1: When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD. 
#2 Rs19-2: He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
#2 Rs19-3: They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them. 
#2 Rs19-4: It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives." 
#2 Rs19-5: When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah, 
#2 Rs19-6: Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard —those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 
#2 Rs19-7: Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'" 
#2 Rs19-8: When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah. 
#2 Rs19-9: Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush, "was marching out to fight against him. So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word: 
#2 Rs19-10: "Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.' 
#2 Rs19-11: Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered? 
#2 Rs19-12: Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them —the gods of Gozan, Harran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar? 
#2 Rs19-13: Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?" 
#2 Rs19-14: Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. 
#2 Rs19-15: And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: "LORD, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. 
#2 Rs19-16: Give ear, LORD, and hear; open your eyes, LORD, and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God. 
#2 Rs19-17: "It is true, LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands. 
#2 Rs19-18: They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands. 
#2 Rs19-19: Now, LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, LORD, are God." 
#2 Rs19-20: Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria. 
#2 Rs19-21: This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: "'Virgin Daughter Zion despises you and mocks you. Daughter Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee. 
#2 Rs19-22: Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel! 
#2 Rs19-23: By your messengers you have ridiculed the Lord. And you have said, "With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its junipers. I have reached its remotest parts, the finest of its forests. 
#2 Rs19-24: I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt." 
#2 Rs19-25: "'Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone. 
#2 Rs19-26: Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up. 
#2 Rs19-27: "'But I know where you are and when you come and go and how you rage against me. 
#2 Rs19-28: Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.' 
#2 Rs19-29: "This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah: "This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
#2 Rs19-30: Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above. 
#2 Rs19-31: For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. "The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this. 
#2 Rs19-32: "Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: "'He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it. 
#2 Rs19-33: By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city, declares the LORD. 
#2 Rs19-34: I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.'"

#2 Rs19-37: One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
 2 REIS 20
#2 Rs20-1: In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, "This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover."

#2 Rs22-17: Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all the idols their hands have made, "my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.' 
#2 Rs22-18: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard: 
#2 Rs22-19: Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people —that they would become a curse "and be laid waste —and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I also have heard you, declares the LORD. 
#2 Rs22-20: Therefore I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.'" So they took her answer back to the king.

#1 Cr19-14: Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
#1 Cr19-15: When the Ammonites realized that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem. 
#1 Cr19-16: After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophak the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them. 
#1 Cr19-17: When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him. 
#1 Cr19-18: But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophak the commander of their army. 
#1 Cr19-19: When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.
 1 CRÔNICAS 20
#1 Cr20-1: In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins. 
#1 Cr20-2: David took the crown from the head of their king "—its weight was found to be a talent "of gold, and it was set with precious stones —and it was placed on David's head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city 
#1 Cr20-3: and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem. 
#1 Cr20-4: In the course of time, war broke out with the Philistines, at Gezer. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaites, and the Philistines were subjugated.

#1 Cr21-1: Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. 
#1 Cr21-2: So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, "Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are." 
#1 Cr21-3: But Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord's subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?" 
#1 Cr21-4: The king's word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem. 
#1 Cr21-5: Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah. 
#1 Cr21-6: But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king's command was repulsive to him. 
#1 Cr21-7: This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel. 
#1 Cr21-8: Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing." 
#1 Cr21-9: The LORD said to Gad, David's seer, 
#1 Cr21-10: "Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'" 
#1 Cr21-11: So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Take your choice: 
#1 Cr21-12: three years of famine, three months of being swept away "before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD —days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.' Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me." 
#1 Cr21-13: David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into human hands." 
#1 Cr21-14: So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead. 
#1 Cr21-15: And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah "the Jebusite. 
#1 Cr21-16: David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown. 
#1 Cr21-17: David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I, the shepherd, "have sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? LORD my God, let your hand fall on me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people." 
#1 Cr21-18: Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 
#1 Cr21-19: So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD. 
#1 Cr21-20: While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves. 
#1 Cr21-21: Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground. 
#1 Cr21-22: David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price." 
#1 Cr21-23: Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this." 
#1 Cr21-24: But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing." 
#1 Cr21-25: So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels "of gold for the site. 
#1 Cr21-26: David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. 
#1 Cr21-27: Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. 
#1 Cr21-28: At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there. 
#1 Cr21-29: The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon. 
#1 Cr21-30: But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
 1 CRÔNICAS 22
#1 Cr22-1: Then David said, "The house of the LORD God is to be here, and also the altar of burnt offering for Israel." 
#1 Cr22-2: So David gave orders to assemble the foreigners residing in Israel, and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God. 
#1 Cr22-3: He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed. 
#1 Cr22-4: He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David. 
#1 Cr22-5: David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it." So David made extensive preparations before his death. 
#1 Cr22-6: Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel. 
#1 Cr22-7: David said to Solomon: "My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God. 
#1 Cr22-8: But this word of the LORD came to me: 'You have shed much blood and have fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight. 
#1 Cr22-9: But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon, "and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign. 
#1 Cr22-10: He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.' 
#1 Cr22-11: "Now, my son, the LORD be with you, and may you have success and build the house of the LORD your God, as he said you would. 
#1 Cr22-12: May the LORD give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God. 
#1 Cr22-13: Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the LORD gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged. 
#1 Cr22-14: "I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the LORD a hundred thousand talents "of gold, a million talents "of silver, quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone. And you may add to them. 
#1 Cr22-15: You have many workers: stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as those skilled in every kind of work 
#1 Cr22-16: in gold and silver, bronze and iron —craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and the LORD be with you." 
#1 Cr22-17: Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon. 
#1 Cr22-18: He said to them, "Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not granted you rest on every side? For he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hands, and the land is subject to the LORD and to his people. 
#1 Cr22-19: Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the LORD your God. Begin to build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the sacred articles belonging to God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD."
 1 CRÔNICAS 23
#1 Cr23-1: When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. 
#1 Cr23-2: He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites. 
#1 Cr23-3: The Levites thirty years old or more were counted, and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand. 
#1 Cr23-4: David said, "Of these, twenty-four thousand are to be in charge of the work of the temple of the LORD and six thousand are to be officials and judges. 
#1 Cr23-5: Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the LORD with the musical instruments I have provided for that purpose." 
#1 Cr23-6: David separated the Levites into divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. 
#1 Cr23-7: Belonging to the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. 
#1 Cr23-8: The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel —three in all. 
#1 Cr23-9: The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran —three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan. 
#1 Cr23-10: And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Ziza, "Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei —four in all. 
#1 Cr23-11: Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment. 
#1 Cr23-12: The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel —four in all. 
#1 Cr23-13: The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before the LORD, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.

#1 Cr23-23: The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth —three in all. 
#1 Cr23-24: These were the descendants of Levi by their families —the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the LORD. 
#1 Cr23-25: For David had said, "Since the LORD, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever, 
#1 Cr23-26: the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service." 
#1 Cr23-27: According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more. 
#1 Cr23-28: The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron's descendants in the service of the temple of the LORD: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God. 
#1 Cr23-29: They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the special flour for the grain offerings, the thin loaves made without yeast, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size. 
#1 Cr23-30: They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD. They were to do the same in the evening 
#1 Cr23-31: and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on the Sabbaths, at the New Moon feasts and at the appointed festivals. They were to serve before the LORD regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them. 
#1 Cr23-32: And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the tent of meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their relatives the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the LORD.
 1 CRÔNICAS 24
#1 Cr24-1: These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
#1 Cr24-2: But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests. 
#1 Cr24-3: With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelek a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering. 
#1 Cr24-4: A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's, and they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of families from Eleazar's descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar's descendants.

#1 Cr24-19: This was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the temple of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their ancestor Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.

#1 Cr24-31: They also cast lots, just as their relatives the descendants of Aaron did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelek, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same as those of the youngest.

#1 Cr29-15: We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. 
#1 Cr29-16: LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. 
#1 Cr29-17: I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things I have given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you. 
#1 Cr29-18: LORD, the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep these desires and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.

#2 Cr6-9: Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood —he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.' 
#2 Cr6-10: "The LORD has kept the promise he made. I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
#2 Cr6-11: There I have placed the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the people of Israel." 
#2 Cr6-12: Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands. 
#2 Cr6-13: Now he had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, "and had placed it in the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven. 
#2 Cr6-14: He said: "LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth —you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way. 
#2 Cr6-15: You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it —as it is today. 
#2 Cr6-16: "Now, LORD, the God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, 'You shall never fail to have a successor to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful in all they do to walk before me according to my law, as you have done.' 
#2 Cr6-17: And now, LORD, the God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David come true. 
#2 Cr6-18: "But will God really dwell on earth with humans? The heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built! 
#2 Cr6-19: Yet, LORD my God, give attention to your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence. 
#2 Cr6-20: May your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, this place of which you said you would put your Name there. May you hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place. 
#2 Cr6-21: Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive. 
#2 Cr6-22: "When anyone wrongs their neighbor and is required to take an oath and they come and swear the oath before your altar in this temple, 
#2 Cr6-23: then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on their heads what they have done, and vindicating the innocent by treating them in accordance with their innocence. 
#2 Cr6-24: "When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back and give praise to your name, praying and making supplication before you in this temple, 
#2 Cr6-25: then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their ancestors. 
#2 Cr6-26: "When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and give praise to your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them, 
#2 Cr6-27: then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance. 
#2 Cr6-28: "When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come, 
#2 Cr6-29: and when a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel —being aware of their afflictions and pains, and spreading out their hands toward this temple — 
#2 Cr6-30: then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive, and deal with everyone according to all they do, since you know their hearts (for you alone know the human heart), 
#2 Cr6-31: so that they will fear you and walk in obedience to you all the time they live in the land you gave our ancestors. 
#2 Cr6-32: "As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm —when they come and pray toward this temple, 
#2 Cr6-33: then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name. 
#2 Cr6-34: "When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name, 
#2 Cr6-35: then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause. 
#2 Cr6-36: "When they sin against you —for there is no one who does not sin —and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to a land far away or near; 
#2 Cr6-37: and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity and say, 'We have sinned, we have done wrong and acted wickedly'; 
#2 Cr6-38: and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken, and pray toward the land you gave their ancestors, toward the city you have chosen and toward the temple I have built for your Name; 
#2 Cr6-39: then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their pleas, and uphold their cause. And forgive your people, who have sinned against you. 
#2 Cr6-40: "Now, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. 
#2 Cr6-41: "Now arise, LORD God, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. May your priests, LORD God, be clothed with salvation, may your faithful people rejoice in your goodness. 
#2 Cr6-42: LORD God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember the great love promised to David your servant."
 2 CRÔNICAS 7
#2 Cr7-1: When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple. 
#2 Cr7-2: The priests could not enter the temple of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled it. 
#2 Cr7-3: When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, "He is good; his love endures forever." 
#2 Cr7-4: Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD. 
#2 Cr7-5: And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God. 
#2 Cr7-6: The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the LORD's musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the LORD and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, "His love endures forever." Opposite the Levites, the priests blew their trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing. 
#2 Cr7-7: Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions. 
#2 Cr7-8: So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him —a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. 
#2 Cr7-9: On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more. 
#2 Cr7-10: On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the LORD had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel. 
#2 Cr7-11: When Solomon had finished the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the LORD and in his own palace, 
#2 Cr7-12: the LORD appeared to him at night and said: "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices. 
#2 Cr7-13: "When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people, 
#2 Cr7-14: if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land. 
#2 Cr7-15: Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. 
#2 Cr7-16: I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there. 
#2 Cr7-17: "As for you, if you walk before me faithfully as David your father did, and do all I command, and observe my decrees and laws, 
#2 Cr7-18: I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father when I said, 'You shall never fail to have a successor to rule over Israel.' 
#2 Cr7-19: "But if you "turn away and forsake the decrees and commands I have given you "and go off to serve other gods and worship them, 
#2 Cr7-20: then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. 
#2 Cr7-21: This temple will become a heap of rubble. All "who pass by will be appalled and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?' 
#2 Cr7-22: People will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them —that is why he brought all this disaster on them.'"
 2 CRÔNICAS 8
#2 Cr8-1: At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built the temple of the LORD and his own palace, 
#2 Cr8-2: Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram "had given him, and settled Israelites in them. 
#2 Cr8-3: Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah and captured it. 
#2 Cr8-4: He also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath. 
#2 Cr8-5: He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars, 
#2 Cr8-6: as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses "—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled. 
#2 Cr8-7: There were still people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these people were not Israelites). 
#2 Cr8-8: Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these people remaining in the land —whom the Israelites had not destroyed —to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day. 
#2 Cr8-9: But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers. 
#2 Cr8-10: They were also King Solomon's chief officials —two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men. 
#2 Cr8-11: Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, "My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy." 
#2 Cr8-12: On the altar of the LORD that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the LORD, 
#2 Cr8-13: according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for the Sabbaths, the New Moons and the three annual festivals —the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Tabernacles. 
#2 Cr8-14: In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day's requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates, because this was what David the man of God had ordered. 
#2 Cr8-15: They did not deviate from the king's commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter, including that of the treasuries. 
#2 Cr8-16: All Solomon's work was carried out, from the day the foundation of the temple of the LORD was laid until its completion. So the temple of the LORD was finished. 
#2 Cr8-17: Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom. 
#2 Cr8-18: And Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own men, sailors who knew the sea. These, with Solomon's men, sailed to Ophir and brought back four hundred and fifty talents "of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
 2 CRÔNICAS 9
#2 Cr9-1: When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. Arriving with a very great caravan —with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones —she came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind. 
#2 Cr9-2: Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her. 
#2 Cr9-3: When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he had built, 
#2 Cr9-4: the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at "the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed. 
#2 Cr9-5: She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. 
#2 Cr9-6: But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard. 
#2 Cr9-7: How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! 
#2 Cr9-8: Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the LORD your God. Because of the love of your God for Israel and his desire to uphold them forever, he has made you king over them, to maintain justice and righteousness." 
#2 Cr9-9: Then she gave the king 120 talents "of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
#2 Cr9-10: (The servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon brought gold from Ophir; they also brought algumwood "and precious stones. 
#2 Cr9-11: The king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like them had ever been seen in Judah.) 
#2 Cr9-12: King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for; he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country. 
#2 Cr9-13: The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents, [^4] 
#2 Cr9-14: not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. Also all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the territories brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
#2 Cr9-15: King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels "of hammered gold went into each shield. 
#2 Cr9-16: He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three hundred shekels "of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. 
#2 Cr9-17: Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with pure gold. 
#2 Cr9-18: The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them. 
#2 Cr9-19: Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom. 
#2 Cr9-20: All King Solomon's goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon's day. 
#2 Cr9-21: The king had a fleet of trading ships "manned by Hiram's "servants. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons. 
#2 Cr9-22: King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth. 
#2 Cr9-23: All the kings of the earth sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart. 
#2 Cr9-24: Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift —articles of silver and gold, and robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules. 
#2 Cr9-25: Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses, "which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. 
#2 Cr9-26: He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. 
#2 Cr9-27: The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. 
#2 Cr9-28: Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from all other countries. 
#2 Cr9-29: As for the other events of Solomon's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat? 
#2 Cr9-30: Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
#2 Cr9-31: Then he rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
 2 CRÔNICAS 10
#2 Cr10-1: Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. 
#2 Cr10-2: When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt. 
#2 Cr10-3: So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him: 
#2 Cr10-4: "Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you." 
#2 Cr10-5: Rehoboam answered, "Come back to me in three days." So the people went away. 
#2 Cr10-6: Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked. 
#2 Cr10-7: They replied, "If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants." 
#2 Cr10-8: But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 
#2 Cr10-9: He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?" 
#2 Cr10-10: The young men who had grown up with him replied, "The people have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.' Now tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. 
#2 Cr10-11: My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'" 
#2 Cr10-12: Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days." 
#2 Cr10-13: The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders, 
#2 Cr10-14: he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions." 
#2 Cr10-15: So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. 
#2 Cr10-16: When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, Israel! Look after your own house, David!" So all the Israelites went home. 
#2 Cr10-17: But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them. 
#2 Cr10-18: King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, "who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. 
#2 Cr10-19: So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
 2 CRÔNICAS 11
#2 Cr11-1: When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered Judah and Benjamin —a hundred and eighty thousand able young men —to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam. 
#2 Cr11-2: But this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God: 
#2 Cr11-3: "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 
#2 Cr11-4: 'This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your fellow Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the words of the LORD and turned back from marching against Jeroboam. 
#2 Cr11-5: Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built up towns for defense in Judah: 
#2 Cr11-6: Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
#2 Cr11-7: Beth Zur, Soko, Adullam, 
#2 Cr11-8: Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
#2 Cr11-9: Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
#2 Cr11-10: Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin. 
#2 Cr11-11: He strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them, with supplies of food, olive oil and wine. 
#2 Cr11-12: He put shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his. 
#2 Cr11-13: The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him. 
#2 Cr11-14: The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD 
#2 Cr11-15: when he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made. 
#2 Cr11-16: Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the LORD, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the LORD, the God of their ancestors. 
#2 Cr11-17: They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon three years, following the ways of David and Solomon during this time. 
#2 Cr11-18: Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse's son Eliab. 
#2 Cr11-19: She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham. 
#2 Cr11-20: Then he married Maakah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith. 
#2 Cr11-21: Rehoboam loved Maakah daughter of Absalom more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. 
#2 Cr11-22: Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maakah as crown prince among his brothers, in order to make him king. 
#2 Cr11-23: He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them.
 2 CRÔNICAS 12
#2 Cr12-1: After Rehoboam's position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel "with him abandoned the law of the LORD. 
#2 Cr12-2: Because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam. 
#2 Cr12-3: With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites "that came with him from Egypt, 
#2 Cr12-4: he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. 
#2 Cr12-5: Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, "This is what the LORD says, 'You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.'" 
#2 Cr12-6: The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is just." 
#2 Cr12-7: When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: "Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak. 
#2 Cr12-8: They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands." 
#2 Cr12-9: When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made. 
#2 Cr12-10: So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. 
#2 Cr12-11: Whenever the king went to the LORD's temple, the guards went with him, bearing the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom. 
#2 Cr12-12: Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the LORD's anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah. 
#2 Cr12-13: King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. 
#2 Cr12-14: He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the LORD. 
#2 Cr12-15: As for the events of Rehoboam's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 
#2 Cr12-16: Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
 2 CRÔNICAS 13
#2 Cr13-1: In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah, 
#2 Cr13-2: and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother's name was Maakah, "a daughter "of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
#2 Cr13-3: Abijah went into battle with an army of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops. 
#2 Cr13-4: Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me! 
#2 Cr13-5: Don't you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt? 
#2 Cr13-6: Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master. 
#2 Cr13-7: Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them. 
#2 Cr13-8: "And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David's descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods. 
#2 Cr13-9: But didn't you drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods. 
#2 Cr13-10: "As for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them. 
#2 Cr13-11: Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the LORD our God. But you have forsaken him. 
#2 Cr13-12: God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. People of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed." 
#2 Cr13-13: Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them. 
#2 Cr13-14: Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets 
#2 Cr13-15: and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
#2 Cr13-16: The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands. 
#2 Cr13-17: Abijah and his troops inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel's able men. 
#2 Cr13-18: The Israelites were subdued on that occasion, and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of their ancestors. 
#2 Cr13-19: Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages.

#2 Cr14-12: The LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled,

#2 Cr16-3: "Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."

#2 Cr16-7: At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: "Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand. 
#2 Cr16-8: Were not the Cushites "and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen "? Yet when you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand. 
#2 Cr16-9: For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."

#2 Cr17-3: The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the ways of his father David before him. He did not consult the Baals

#2 Cr18-1: Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. 
#2 Cr18-2: Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead. 
#2 Cr18-3: Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war." 
#2 Cr18-4: But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD." 
#2 Cr18-5: So the king of Israel brought together the prophets —four hundred men —and asked them, "Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?" "Go," they answered, "for God will give it into the king's hand." 
#2 Cr18-6: But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no longer a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?" 
#2 Cr18-7: The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say such a thing," Jehoshaphat replied. 
#2 Cr18-8: So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once." 
#2 Cr18-9: Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
#2 Cr18-10: Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, "This is what the LORD says: 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'" 
#2 Cr18-11: All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand." 
#2 Cr18-12: The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably." 
#2 Cr18-13: But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what my God says." 
#2 Cr18-14: When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for they will be given into your hand." 
#2 Cr18-15: The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?" 
#2 Cr18-16: Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'" 
#2 Cr18-17: The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?" 
#2 Cr18-18: Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing on his right and on his left. 
#2 Cr18-19: And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that. 
#2 Cr18-20: Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.' "'By what means?' the LORD asked. 
#2 Cr18-21: "'I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.' 
#2 Cr18-22: "So now the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you." 
#2 Cr18-23: Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from "the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked. 
#2 Cr18-24: Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room." 
#2 Cr18-25: The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son, 
#2 Cr18-26: and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'" 
#2 Cr18-27: Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!" 
#2 Cr18-28: So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
#2 Cr18-29: The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. 
#2 Cr18-30: Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel." 
#2 Cr18-31: When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him, 
#2 Cr18-32: for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him. 
#2 Cr18-33: But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the breastplate and the scale armor. The king told the chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded." 
#2 Cr18-34: All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died.

#2 Cr19-1: When Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem, 
#2 Cr19-2: Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to the king, "Should you help the wicked and love "those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the wrath of the LORD is on you. 
#2 Cr19-3: There is, however, some good in you, for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God."

#2 Cr19-5: He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah. 
#2 Cr19-6: He told them, "Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for mere mortals but for the LORD, who is with you whenever you give a verdict. 
#2 Cr19-7: Now let the fear of the LORD be on you. Judge carefully, for with the LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery." 
#2 Cr19-8: In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the LORD and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem. 
#2 Cr19-9: He gave them these orders: "You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD. 
#2 Cr19-10: In every case that comes before you from your people who live in the cities —whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees or regulations —you are to warn them not to sin against the LORD; otherwise his wrath will come on you and your people. Do this, and you will not sin. 
#2 Cr19-11: "Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in any matter concerning the king, and the Levites will serve as officials before you. Act with courage, and may the LORD be with those who do well."

#2 Cr20-2: Some people came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast army is coming against you from Edom, "from the other side of the Dead Sea. It is already in Hazezon Tamar" (that is, En Gedi). 
#2 Cr20-3: Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the LORD, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah. 
#2 Cr20-4: The people of Judah came together to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him. 
#2 Cr20-5: Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the LORD in the front of the new courtyard 
#2 Cr20-6: and said: "LORD, the God of our ancestors, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you. 
#2 Cr20-7: Our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend? 
#2 Cr20-8: They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name, saying, 
#2 Cr20-9: 'If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.' 
#2 Cr20-10: "But now here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them. 
#2 Cr20-11: See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance. 
#2 Cr20-12: Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you." 
#2 Cr20-13: All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the LORD. 
#2 Cr20-14: Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly. 
#2 Cr20-15: He said: "Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the LORD says to you: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God's. 
#2 Cr20-16: Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel. 
#2 Cr20-17: You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the LORD will give you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the LORD will be with you.'" 
#2 Cr20-18: Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the LORD. 
#2 Cr20-19: Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice. 
#2 Cr20-20: Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful." 
#2 Cr20-21: After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the LORD and to praise him for the splendor of his "holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: "Give thanks to the LORD, for his love endures forever." 
#2 Cr20-22: As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated. 
#2 Cr20-23: The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another. 
#2 Cr20-24: When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped. 
#2 Cr20-25: So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing "and also articles of value —more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it. 
#2 Cr20-26: On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, where they praised the LORD. This is why it is called the Valley of Berakah "to this day. 
#2 Cr20-27: Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies. 
#2 Cr20-28: They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the LORD with harps and lyres and trumpets. 
#2 Cr20-29: The fear of God came on all the surrounding kingdoms when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel. 
#2 Cr20-30: And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side. 
#2 Cr20-31: So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
#2 Cr20-32: He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. 
#2 Cr20-33: The high places, however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their ancestors. 
#2 Cr20-34: The other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel. 
#2 Cr20-35: Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, whose ways were wicked. 
#2 Cr20-36: He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships. "After these were built at Ezion Geber, 
#2 Cr20-37: Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made." The ships were wrecked and were not able to set sail to trade. [^7]
 2 CRÔNICAS 21
#2 Cr21-1: Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king. 
#2 Cr21-2: Jehoram's brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. [^1] 
#2 Cr21-3: Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son. 
#2 Cr21-4: When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father's kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the officials of Israel. 
#2 Cr21-5: Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
#2 Cr21-6: He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD. 
#2 Cr21-7: Nevertheless, because of the covenant the LORD had made with David, the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever. 
#2 Cr21-8: In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king. 
#2 Cr21-9: So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night. 
#2 Cr21-10: To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his ancestors. 
#2 Cr21-11: He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray. 
#2 Cr21-12: Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said: "This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: 'You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah. 
#2 Cr21-13: But you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your own family, men who were better than you. 
#2 Cr21-14: So now the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a heavy blow. 
#2 Cr21-15: You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.'"

#2 Cr21-17: They attacked Judah, invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king's palace, together with his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah, "the youngest. 
#2 Cr21-18: After all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels. 
#2 Cr21-19: In the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people made no funeral fire in his honor, as they had for his predecessors. 
#2 Cr21-20: Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He passed away, to no one's regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
 2 CRÔNICAS 22
#2 Cr22-1: The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram's youngest son, king in his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. 
#2 Cr22-2: Ahaziah was twenty-two "years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri. 
#2 Cr22-3: He too followed the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him to act wickedly.

#2 Cr22-5: He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram "son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;

#2 Cr23-8: The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men —those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty —for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.

#2 Cr23-14: Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them: "Bring her out between the ranks "and put to the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "Do not put her to death at the temple of the LORD." 
#2 Cr23-15: So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.

#2 Cr24-12: The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the LORD's temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple.

#2 Cr24-25: When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.

#2 Cr25-17: After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash "son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: "Come, let us face each other in battle."

#2 Cr29-21: They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering "for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the LORD. 
#2 Cr29-22: So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and splashed it against the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and splashed their blood against the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and splashed their blood against the altar. 
#2 Cr29-23: The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them. 
#2 Cr29-24: The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel. 
#2 Cr29-25: He stationed the Levites in the temple of the LORD with cymbals, harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king's seer and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the LORD through his prophets. 
#2 Cr29-26: So the Levites stood ready with David's instruments, and the priests with their trumpets. 
#2 Cr29-27: Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the LORD began also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel.

#2 Cr29-29: When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped. 
#2 Cr29-30: King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed down and worshiped. 
#2 Cr29-31: Then Hezekiah said, "You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the LORD." So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings. 
#2 Cr29-32: The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs —all of them for burnt offerings to the LORD. 
#2 Cr29-33: The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats. 
#2 Cr29-34: The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their relatives the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been. 
#2 Cr29-35: There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. So the service of the temple of the LORD was reestablished. 
#2 Cr29-36: Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly.

#2 Cr30-7: Do not be like your parents and your fellow Israelites, who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their ancestors, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see.

#2 Cr30-17: Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs "to the LORD. 
#2 Cr30-18: Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the LORD, who is good, pardon everyone 
#2 Cr30-19: who sets their heart on seeking God —the LORD, the God of their ancestors —even if they are not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary."

#2 Cr30-26: There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem. 
#2 Cr30-27: The priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard them, for their prayer reached heaven, his holy dwelling place.
 2 CRÔNICAS 31
#2 Cr31-1: When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.

#2 Cr31-8: When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the LORD and blessed his people Israel. 
#2 Cr31-9: Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps; 
#2 Cr31-10: and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, "Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the LORD has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over." 
#2 Cr31-11: Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the LORD, and this was done.

#2 Cr31-13: Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother. All these served by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God.

#2 Cr31-18: They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves. 
#2 Cr31-19: As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farmlands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites. 
#2 Cr31-20: This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God.

 2 CRÔNICAS 32
#2 Cr32-1: After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself. 
#2 Cr32-2: When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem, 
#2 Cr32-3: he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him. 
#2 Cr32-4: A large force of men assembled, and they blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?" they said. 
#2 Cr32-5: Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields. 
#2 Cr32-6: He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words: 
#2 Cr32-7: "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him. 
#2 Cr32-8: With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said. 
#2 Cr32-9: Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there: 
#2 Cr32-10: "This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege? 
#2 Cr32-11: When Hezekiah says, 'The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,' he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst. 
#2 Cr32-12: Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god's high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it'? 
#2 Cr32-13: "Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand? 
#2 Cr32-14: Who of all the gods of these nations that my fathers destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand? 
#2 Cr32-15: Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!" 
#2 Cr32-16: Sennacherib's officers spoke further against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah. 
#2 Cr32-17: The king also wrote letters insulting the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: "Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand."

#2 Cr32-19: They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world-the work of men's hands. 
#2 Cr32-20: King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this. 
#2 Cr32-21: And the LORD sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the leaders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons cut him down with the sword.

#2 Cr32-23: Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations. 
#2 Cr32-24: In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the LORD, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign. 
#2 Cr32-25: But Hezekiah's heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the LORD's wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem. 
#2 Cr32-26: Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the LORD's wrath did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah. 
#2 Cr32-27: Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables.

#2 Cr32-30: It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook.

#2 Cr33-5: In both courts of the temple of the LORD, he built altars to all the starry hosts. 
#2 Cr33-6: He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, arousing his anger. 
#2 Cr33-7: He took the image he had made and put it in God's temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever. 
#2 Cr33-8: I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and regulations given through Moses." 
#2 Cr33-9: But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites. 
#2 Cr33-10: The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention. 
#2 Cr33-11: So the LORD brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon. 
#2 Cr33-12: In his distress he sought the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors. 
#2 Cr33-13: And when he prayed to him, the LORD was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God. 
#2 Cr33-14: Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah. 
#2 Cr33-15: He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the LORD, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he threw them out of the city. 
#2 Cr33-16: Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel. 
#2 Cr33-17: The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the LORD their God. 
#2 Cr33-18: The other events of Manasseh's reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel. [^1] 
#2 Cr33-19: His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty, as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself —all these are written in the records of the seers. [^2]

#2 Cr33-21: Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. 
#2 Cr33-22: He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh had made. 
#2 Cr33-23: But unlike his father Manasseh, he did not humble himself before the LORD; Amon increased his guilt. 
#2 Cr33-24: Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.

#2 Cr34-17: They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers."

#2 Cr34-20: He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, "Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king's attendant: 
#2 Cr34-21: "Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD's anger that is poured out on us because those who have gone before us have not kept the word of the LORD; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book." 
#2 Cr34-22: Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him "went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, "the son of Hasrah, "keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter. 
#2 Cr34-23: She said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me, 
#2 Cr34-24: 'This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people —all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah. 
#2 Cr34-25: Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all that their hands have made, "my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.' 
#2 Cr34-26: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard: 
#2 Cr34-27: Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD. 
#2 Cr34-28: Now I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.'" So they took her answer back to the king.

#2 Cr34-30: He went up to the temple of the LORD with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites —all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD. 
#2 Cr34-31: The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD —to follow the LORD and keep his commands, statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book.

#Ed4-12: The king should know that the people who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.

#Ed4-14: Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king, 
#Ed4-15: so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place with a long history of sedition. That is why this city was destroyed. 
#Ed4-16: We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates. 
#Ed4-17: The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates: Greetings.

#Ed6-5: Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the house of God. 
#Ed6-6: Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and you, their fellow officials of that province, stay away from there. 
#Ed6-7: Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site. 
#Ed6-8: Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God: The expenses of these men are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that the work will not stop. 
#Ed6-9: Whatever is needed-young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem-must be given them daily without fail, 
#Ed6-10: so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons. 
#Ed6-11: Furthermore, I decree that if anyone changes this edict, a beam is to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it. And for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble. 
#Ed6-12: May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.

#Ed7-10: For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel. 
#Ed7-11: This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the LORD for Israel: 
#Ed7-12: Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, teacher of the Law of the God of heaven: Greetings. 
#Ed7-13: Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests and Levites, who volunteer to go to Jerusalem with you, may go. 
#Ed7-14: You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand. 
#Ed7-15: Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 
#Ed7-16: together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem. 
#Ed7-17: With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem. 
#Ed7-18: You and your fellow Israelites may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God. 
#Ed7-19: Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God. 
#Ed7-20: And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you are responsible to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury. 
#Ed7-21: Now I, King Artaxerxes, decree that all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates are to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you — 
#Ed7-22: up to a hundred talents "of silver, a hundred cors "of wheat, a hundred baths "of wine, a hundred baths "of olive oil, and salt without limit. 
#Ed7-23: Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should his wrath fall on the realm of the king and of his sons? 
#Ed7-24: You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God. 
#Ed7-25: And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates —all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them. 
#Ed7-26: Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment. [^5] 
#Ed7-27: Praise be to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, who has put it into the king's heart to bring honor to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem in this way 
#Ed7-28: and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king's powerful officials. Because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me.

#Ed8-15: I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there. 
#Ed8-16: So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning, 
#Ed8-17: and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God. 
#Ed8-18: Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah's sons and brothers, 18 in all; 
#Ed8-19: and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all. 
#Ed8-20: They also brought 220 of the temple servants —a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name. 
#Ed8-21: There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. 
#Ed8-22: I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him." 
#Ed8-23: So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer. 
#Ed8-24: Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers, 
#Ed8-25: and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God. 
#Ed8-26: I weighed out to them 650 talents "of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, "100 talents "of gold, 
#Ed8-27: 20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, "and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold. 
#Ed8-28: I said to them, "You as well as these articles are consecrated to the LORD. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your ancestors. 
#Ed8-29: Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel." 
#Ed8-30: Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem. 
#Ed8-31: On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way. 
#Ed8-32: So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days. 
#Ed8-33: On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 
#Ed8-34: Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time. 
#Ed8-35: Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering, "twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD. 
#Ed8-36: They also delivered the king's orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God.
 ESDRAS 9
#Ed9-1: After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, "The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites. 
#Ed9-2: They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness." 
#Ed9-3: When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled. 
#Ed9-4: Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice. 
#Ed9-5: Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God 
#Ed9-6: and prayed: "I am too ashamed and disgraced, my God, to lift up my face to you, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens. 
#Ed9-7: From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today. 
#Ed9-8: "But now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place "in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage. 
#Ed9-9: Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem. 
#Ed9-10: "But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commands 
#Ed9-11: you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: 'The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other. 
#Ed9-12: Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.' 
#Ed9-13: "What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us a remnant like this. 
#Ed9-14: Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor? 
#Ed9-15: LORD, the God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence."
 ESDRAS 10
#Ed10-1: While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites —men, women and children —gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. 
#Ed10-2: Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. 
#Ed10-3: Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. 
#Ed10-4: Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it." 
#Ed10-5: So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. 
#Ed10-6: Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles. 
#Ed10-7: A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. 
#Ed10-8: Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles. 
#Ed10-9: Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. 
#Ed10-10: Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt. 
#Ed10-11: Now honor "the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives." 
#Ed10-12: The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say. 
#Ed10-13: But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. 
#Ed10-14: Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us." 
#Ed10-15: Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this. 
#Ed10-16: So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, 
#Ed10-17: and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women. 
#Ed10-18: Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women: From the descendants of Joshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah. 
#Ed10-19: (They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.) 
#Ed10-20: From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. 
#Ed10-21: From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah.

 NEEMIAS 1
#Ne1-1: The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah: In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, 
#Ne1-2: Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem. 
#Ne1-3: They said to me, "Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire." 
#Ne1-4: When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. 
#Ne1-5: Then I said: "LORD, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, 
#Ne1-6: let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's family, have committed against you. 
#Ne1-7: We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses. 
#Ne1-8: "Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations, 
#Ne1-9: but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.' 
#Ne1-10: "They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand. 
#Ne1-11: Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man." I was cupbearer to the king.
 NEEMIAS 2
#Ne2-1: In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before, 
#Ne2-2: so the king asked me, "Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart." I was very much afraid, 
#Ne2-3: but I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?" 
#Ne2-4: The king said to me, "What is it you want?" Then I prayed to the God of heaven, 
#Ne2-5: and I answered the king, "If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it." 
#Ne2-6: Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?" It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time. 
#Ne2-7: I also said to him, "If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah? 
#Ne2-8: And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?" And because the gracious hand of my God was on me, the king granted my requests. 
#Ne2-9: So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me. 
#Ne2-10: When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites. 
#Ne2-11: I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days 
#Ne2-12: I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on. 
#Ne2-13: By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal "Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire. 
#Ne2-14: Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through; 
#Ne2-15: so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate. 
#Ne2-16: The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work. 
#Ne2-17: Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace." 
#Ne2-18: I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me. They replied, "Let us start rebuilding." So they began this good work. 
#Ne2-19: But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you are doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?" 
#Ne2-20: I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it."

#Ne4-2: and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, "What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble —burned as they are?"

#Ne4-4: Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. 
#Ne4-5: Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of "the builders. 
#Ne4-6: So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart. 
#Ne4-7: But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry. 
#Ne4-8: They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it. 
#Ne4-9: But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat. 
#Ne4-10: Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall." 
#Ne4-11: Also our enemies said, "Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work." 
#Ne4-12: Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us." 
#Ne4-13: Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows. 
#Ne4-14: After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes." 
#Ne4-15: When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work. 
#Ne4-16: From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah 
#Ne4-17: who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other, 
#Ne4-18: and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me. 
#Ne4-19: Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall. 
#Ne4-20: Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!" 
#Ne4-21: So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out. 
#Ne4-22: At that time I also said to the people, "Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and as workers by day." 
#Ne4-23: Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water. [^3]
 NEEMIAS 5
#Ne5-1: Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews. 
#Ne5-2: Some were saying, "We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain." 
#Ne5-3: Others were saying, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine." 
#Ne5-4: Still others were saying, "We have had to borrow money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards. 
#Ne5-5: Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others." 
#Ne5-6: When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry. 
#Ne5-7: I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, "You are charging your own people interest!" So I called together a large meeting to deal with them 
#Ne5-8: and said: "As far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say. 
#Ne5-9: So I continued, "What you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies? 
#Ne5-10: I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let us stop charging interest! 
#Ne5-11: Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the interest you are charging them —one percent of the money, grain, new wine and olive oil." 
#Ne5-12: "We will give it back," they said. "And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say." Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised. 
#Ne5-13: I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!" At this the whole assembly said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised. 
#Ne5-14: Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year —twelve years —neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. 
#Ne5-15: But the earlier governors —those preceding me —placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels "of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that. 
#Ne5-16: Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we "did not acquire any land. 
#Ne5-17: Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations. 
#Ne5-18: Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people. 
#Ne5-19: Remember me with favor, my God, for all I have done for these people.
 NEEMIAS 6
#Ne6-1: When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it —though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates — 
#Ne6-2: Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: "Come, let us meet together in one of the villages "on the plain of Ono." But they were scheming to harm me; 
#Ne6-3: so I sent messengers to them with this reply: "I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?" 
#Ne6-4: Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer. 
#Ne6-5: Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter 
#Ne6-6: in which was written: "It is reported among the nations —and Geshem "says it is true —that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king 
#Ne6-7: and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: 'There is a king in Judah!' Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together." 
#Ne6-8: I sent him this reply: "Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head." 
#Ne6-9: They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed." But I prayed, "Now strengthen my hands." 
#Ne6-10: One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, "Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you —by night they are coming to kill you." 
#Ne6-11: But I said, "Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!" 
#Ne6-12: I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
#Ne6-13: He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me. 
#Ne6-14: Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me. 
#Ne6-15: So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days. 
#Ne6-16: When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God. 
#Ne6-17: Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. 
#Ne6-18: For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. 
#Ne6-19: Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
 NEEMIAS 7
#Ne7-1: After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, the musicians and the Levites were appointed. 
#Ne7-2: I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most people do. 
#Ne7-3: I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses." 
#Ne7-4: Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt. 
#Ne7-5: So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there: 
#Ne7-6: These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,

#Ne7-63: And from among the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz and Barzillai (a man who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name). 
#Ne7-64: These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 
#Ne7-65: The governor, therefore, ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there should be a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim.

 NEEMIAS 8
#Ne8-1: all the people came together as one in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the teacher of the Law to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded for Israel. 
#Ne8-2: So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand. 
#Ne8-3: He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law. 
#Ne8-4: Ezra the teacher of the Law stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam. 
#Ne8-5: Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up. 
#Ne8-6: Ezra praised the LORD, the great God; and all the people lifted their hands and responded, "Amen! Amen!" Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. 
#Ne8-7: The Levites —Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah —instructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there. 
#Ne8-8: They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear "and giving the meaning so that the people understood what was being read. 
#Ne8-9: Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and teacher of the Law, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, "This day is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law. 
#Ne8-10: Nehemiah said, "Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength." 
#Ne8-11: The Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for this is a holy day. Do not grieve." 
#Ne8-12: Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them. 
#Ne8-13: On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the teacher to give attention to the words of the Law. 
#Ne8-14: They found written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in temporary shelters during the festival of the seventh month 
#Ne8-15: and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: "Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and shade trees, to make temporary shelters" —as it is written. [^2] 
#Ne8-16: So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves temporary shelters on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim. 
#Ne8-17: The whole company that had returned from exile built temporary shelters and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great. 
#Ne8-18: Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly.
 NEEMIAS 9
#Ne9-1: On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and putting dust on their heads. 
#Ne9-2: Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors. 
#Ne9-3: They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day, and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the LORD their God. 
#Ne9-4: Standing on the stairs of the Levites were Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani. They cried out with loud voices to the LORD their God. 
#Ne9-5: And the Levites —Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah —said: "Stand up and praise the LORD your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting. "" "Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise. 
#Ne9-6: You alone are the LORD. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you. 
#Ne9-7: "You are the LORD God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham. 
#Ne9-8: You found his heart faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites and Girgashites. You have kept your promise because you are righteous. 
#Ne9-9: "You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt; you heard their cry at the Red Sea. [^2] 
#Ne9-10: You sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day. 
#Ne9-11: You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters. 
#Ne9-12: By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take. 
#Ne9-13: "You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good. 
#Ne9-14: You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses. 
#Ne9-15: In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them. 
#Ne9-16: "But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. 
#Ne9-17: They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, 
#Ne9-18: even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' or when they committed awful blasphemies. 
#Ne9-19: "Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. 
#Ne9-20: You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. 
#Ne9-21: For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen. 
#Ne9-22: "You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon "king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan. 
#Ne9-23: You made their children as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their parents to enter and possess. 
#Ne9-24: Their children went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you gave the Canaanites into their hands, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased. 
#Ne9-25: They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness. 
#Ne9-26: "But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they turned their backs on your law. They killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies. 
#Ne9-27: So you delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies. 
#Ne9-28: "But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time. 
#Ne9-29: "You warned them in order to turn them back to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, of which you said, 'The person who obeys them will live by them.' Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. 
#Ne9-30: For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you gave them into the hands of the neighboring peoples. 
#Ne9-31: But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God. 
#Ne9-32: "Now therefore, our God, the great God, mighty and awesome, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes —the hardship that has come on us, on our kings and leaders, on our priests and prophets, on our ancestors and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today. 
#Ne9-33: In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we acted wickedly. 
#Ne9-34: Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our ancestors did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the statutes you warned them to keep. 
#Ne9-35: Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways. 
#Ne9-36: "But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our ancestors so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces. 
#Ne9-37: Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress. 
#Ne9-38: "In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it." [^4]

#Ne10-33: for the bread set out on the table; for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings; for the offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moon feasts and at the appointed festivals; for the holy offerings; for sin offerings "to make atonement for Israel; and for all the duties of the house of our God. 
#Ne10-34: "We —the priests, the Levites and the people —have cast lots to determine when each of our families is to bring to the house of our God at set times each year a contribution of wood to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the Law. 
#Ne10-35: "We also assume responsibility for bringing to the house of the LORD each year the firstfruits of our crops and of every fruit tree. 
#Ne10-36: "As it is also written in the Law, we will bring the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, of our herds and of our flocks to the house of our God, to the priests ministering there. 
#Ne10-37: "Moreover, we will bring to the storerooms of the house of our God, to the priests, the first of our ground meal, of our grain offerings, of the fruit of all our trees and of our new wine and olive oil. And we will bring a tithe of our crops to the Levites, for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all the towns where we work. 
#Ne10-38: A priest descended from Aaron is to accompany the Levites when they receive the tithes, and the Levites are to bring a tenth of the tithes up to the house of our God, to the storerooms of the treasury. 
#Ne10-39: The people of Israel, including the Levites, are to bring their contributions of grain, new wine and olive oil to the storerooms, where the articles for the sanctuary and for the ministering priests, the gatekeepers and the musicians are also kept. "We will not neglect the house of our God."

#Ne12-24: And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their associates, who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as prescribed by David the man of God. 
#Ne12-25: Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.

#Ne12-27: At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres. 
#Ne12-28: The musicians also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem —from the villages of the Netophathites, 
#Ne12-29: from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the musicians had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. 
#Ne12-30: When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall. 
#Ne12-31: I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of "the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of "the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate. 
#Ne12-32: Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them, 
#Ne12-33: along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
#Ne12-34: Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,

#Ne12-36: and his associates —Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani —with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the teacher of the Law led the procession. 
#Ne12-37: At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the site of David's palace to the Water Gate on the east. 
#Ne12-38: The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of "the wall, together with half the people —past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 
#Ne12-39: over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah "Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped. 
#Ne12-40: The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials, 
#Ne12-41: as well as the priests —Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets — 
#Ne12-42: and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah. 
#Ne12-43: And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away. 
#Ne12-44: At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites. 
#Ne12-45: They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the musicians and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon. 
#Ne12-46: For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the musicians and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
#Ne12-47: So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.
 NEEMIAS 13
#Ne13-1: On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God, 
#Ne13-2: because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.) 
#Ne13-3: When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent. 
#Ne13-4: Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah, 
#Ne13-5: and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, musicians and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests. 
#Ne13-6: But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission 
#Ne13-7: and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God. 
#Ne13-8: I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah's household goods out of the room. 
#Ne13-9: I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense. 
#Ne13-10: I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, and that all the Levites and musicians responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields. 
#Ne13-11: So I rebuked the officials and asked them, "Why is the house of God neglected?" Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts. 
#Ne13-12: All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and olive oil into the storerooms. 
#Ne13-13: I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because they were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites. 
#Ne13-14: Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services. 
#Ne13-15: In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day. 
#Ne13-16: People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah. 
#Ne13-17: I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this wicked thing you are doing —desecrating the Sabbath day? 
#Ne13-18: Didn't your ancestors do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity on us and on this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath." 
#Ne13-19: When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day. 
#Ne13-20: Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem. 
#Ne13-21: But I warned them and said, "Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you." From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath. 
#Ne13-22: Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, my God, and show mercy to me according to your great love. 
#Ne13-23: Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab. 
#Ne13-24: Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah. 
#Ne13-25: I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God's name and said: "You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves. 
#Ne13-26: Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women. 
#Ne13-27: Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?" 
#Ne13-28: One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me. 
#Ne13-29: Remember them, my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites. 
#Ne13-30: So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task. 
#Ne13-31: I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me with favor, my God.

 ESTER 1
#Et1-1: This is what happened during the time of Xerxes, "the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush ": 
#Et1-2: At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa, 
#Et1-3: and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present. 
#Et1-4: For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty. 
#Et1-5: When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king's palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa. 
#Et1-6: The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones. 
#Et1-7: Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king's liberality. 
#Et1-8: By the king's command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished. 
#Et1-9: Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes. 
#Et1-10: On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him —Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Karkas — 
#Et1-11: to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at. 
#Et1-12: But when the attendants delivered the king's command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger. 
#Et1-13: Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times 
#Et1-14: and were closest to the king —Karshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memukan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom. 
#Et1-15: "According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?" he asked. "She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her." 
#Et1-16: Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, "Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes. 
#Et1-17: For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, 'King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.' 
#Et1-18: This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen's conduct will respond to all the king's nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord. 
#Et1-19: "Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she. 
#Et1-20: Then when the king's edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest." 
#Et1-21: The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memukan proposed. 
#Et1-22: He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every man should be ruler over his own household, using his native tongue.
 ESTER 2
#Et2-1: Later when King Xerxes' fury had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her. 
#Et2-2: Then the king's personal attendants proposed, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king. 
#Et2-3: Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them. 
#Et2-4: Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it. 
#Et2-5: Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, 
#Et2-6: who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin "king of Judah. 
#Et2-7: Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This young woman, who was also known as Esther, had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died. 
#Et2-8: When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed, many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem. 
#Et2-9: She pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven female attendants selected from the king's palace and moved her and her attendants into the best place in the harem. 
#Et2-10: Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so. 
#Et2-11: Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her. 
#Et2-12: Before a young woman's turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics. 
#Et2-13: And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace. 
#Et2-14: In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name. 
#Et2-15: When the turn came for Esther (the young woman Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her. 
#Et2-16: She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 
#Et2-17: Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
#Et2-18: And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality. 
#Et2-19: When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate. 
#Et2-20: But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai's instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up. 
#Et2-21: During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthana "and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. 
#Et2-22: But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai. 
#Et2-23: And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were impaled on poles. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.
 ESTER 3
#Et3-1: After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles. 
#Et3-2: All the royal officials at the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor. 
#Et3-3: Then the royal officials at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's command?" 
#Et3-4: Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew. 
#Et3-5: When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged. 
#Et3-6: Yet having learned who Mordecai's people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes. 
#Et3-7: In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, they cast the pur (that is, the lot) in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar. 
#Et3-8: Then Haman said to King Xerxes, "There is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose customs are different from those of all other people and who do not obey the king's laws; it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them. 
#Et3-9: If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will put ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury for the men who carry out this business." 
#Et3-10: So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 
#Et3-11: "Keep the money," the king said to Haman, "and do with the people as you please." 
#Et3-12: Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman's orders to the king's satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring. 
#Et3-13: Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews-young and old, women and little children-on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. 
#Et3-14: A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day. 
#Et3-15: Spurred on by the king's command, the couriers went out, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.
 ESTER 4
#Et4-1: When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. 
#Et4-2: But he went only as far as the king's gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it. 
#Et4-3: In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes. 
#Et4-4: When Esther's eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. 
#Et4-5: Then Esther summoned Hathak, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why. 
#Et4-6: So Hathak went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate. 
#Et4-7: Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews. 
#Et4-8: He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to instruct her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people. 
#Et4-9: Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said. 
#Et4-10: Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai, 
#Et4-11: "All the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king." 
#Et4-12: When Esther's words were reported to Mordecai, 
#Et4-13: he sent back this answer: "Do not think that because you are in the king's house you alone of all the Jews will escape. 
#Et4-14: For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?" 
#Et4-15: Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: 
#Et4-16: "Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish." 
#Et4-17: So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions.
 ESTER 5
#Et5-1: On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance. 
#Et5-2: When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. 
#Et5-3: Then the king asked, "What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you." 
#Et5-4: "If it pleases the king," replied Esther, "let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him." 
#Et5-5: "Bring Haman at once," the king said, "so that we may do what Esther asks." So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared. 
#Et5-6: As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, "Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted." 
#Et5-7: Esther replied, "My petition and my request is this: 
#Et5-8: If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king's question." 
#Et5-9: Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence, he was filled with rage against Mordecai. 
#Et5-10: Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. Calling together his friends and Zeresh, his wife, 
#Et5-11: Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials. 
#Et5-12: "And that's not all," Haman added. "I'm the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow. 
#Et5-13: But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate." 
#Et5-14: His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Have a pole set up, reaching to a height of fifty cubits, "and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai impaled on it. Then go with the king to the banquet and enjoy yourself." This suggestion delighted Haman, and he had the pole set up.
 ESTER 6
#Et6-1: That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him. 
#Et6-2: It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. 
#Et6-3: "What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?" the king asked. "Nothing has been done for him," his attendants answered. 
#Et6-4: The king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole he had set up for him. 
#Et6-5: His attendants answered, "Haman is standing in the court." "Bring him in," the king ordered. 
#Et6-6: When Haman entered, the king asked him, "What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?" Now Haman thought to himself, "Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?" 
#Et6-7: So he answered the king, "For the man the king delights to honor, 
#Et6-8: have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head. 
#Et6-9: Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, 'This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!'" 
#Et6-10: "Go at once," the king commanded Haman. "Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended." 
#Et6-11: So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, "This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!" 
#Et6-12: Afterward Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief, 
#Et6-13: and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, "Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him —you will surely come to ruin!" 
#Et6-14: While they were still talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.
 ESTER 7
#Et7-1: So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther's banquet, 
#Et7-2: and as they were drinking wine on the second day, the king again asked, "Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted." 
#Et7-3: Then Queen Esther answered, "If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life —this is my petition. And spare my people —this is my request. 
#Et7-4: For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king. "" 
#Et7-5: King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, "Who is he? Where is he —the man who has dared to do such a thing?" 
#Et7-6: Esther said, "An adversary and enemy! This vile Haman!" Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 
#Et7-7: The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. 
#Et7-8: Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, "Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?" As soon as the word left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 
#Et7-9: Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, "A pole reaching to a height of fifty cubits "stands by Haman's house. He had it set up for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king." The king said, "Impale him on it!" 
#Et7-10: So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai. Then the king's fury subsided.
 ESTER 8
#Et8-1: That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her. 
#Et8-2: The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman's estate. 
#Et8-3: Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews. 
#Et8-4: Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him. 
#Et8-5: "If it pleases the king," she said, "and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces. 
#Et8-6: For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?" 
#Et8-7: King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled him on the pole he set up. 
#Et8-8: Now write another decree in the king's name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king's signet ring —for no document written in the king's name and sealed with his ring can be revoked." 
#Et8-9: At once the royal secretaries were summoned —on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai's orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush. "These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language. 
#Et8-10: Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king's signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king. 
#Et8-11: The king's edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children, "and to plunder the property of their enemies. 
#Et8-12: The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. 
#Et8-13: A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
#Et8-14: The couriers, riding the royal horses, went out, spurred on by the king's command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. 
#Et8-15: When Mordecai left the king's presence, he was wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration. 
#Et8-16: For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor. 
#Et8-17: In every province and in every city to which the edict of the king came, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.
 ESTER 9
#Et9-1: On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them. 
#Et9-2: The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those determined to destroy them. No one could stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them. 
#Et9-3: And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the king's administrators helped the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them. 
#Et9-4: Mordecai was prominent in the palace; his reputation spread throughout the provinces, and he became more and more powerful. 
#Et9-5: The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them. 
#Et9-6: In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. 
#Et9-7: They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
#Et9-8: Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
#Et9-9: Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha, 
#Et9-10: the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the plunder. 
#Et9-11: The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day. 
#Et9-12: The king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted." 
#Et9-13: "If it pleases the king," Esther answered, "give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day's edict tomorrow also, and let Haman's ten sons be impaled on poles." 
#Et9-14: So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they impaled the ten sons of Haman. 
#Et9-15: The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. 
#Et9-16: Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king's provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder. 
#Et9-17: This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy. 
#Et9-18: The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth, and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy. 
#Et9-19: That is why rural Jews —those living in villages —observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to each other. 
#Et9-20: Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far, 
#Et9-21: to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar 
#Et9-22: as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor. 
#Et9-23: So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them. 
#Et9-24: For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the (that is, the lot) for their ruin and destruction. 
#Et9-25: But when the plot came to the king's attention, "he issued written orders that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back onto his own head, and that he and his sons should be impaled on poles. 
#Et9-26: (Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word .) Because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them, 
#Et9-27: the Jews took it on themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed. 
#Et9-28: These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, and in every province and in every city. And these days of Purim should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews —nor should the memory of these days die out among their descendants. 
#Et9-29: So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim. 
#Et9-30: And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of Xerxes' kingdom —words of goodwill and assurance — 
#Et9-31: to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation. 
#Et9-32: Esther's decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records.
 ESTER 10
#Et10-1: King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores. 
#Et10-2: And all his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia? 
#Et10-3: Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews, because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews.

#Jó1-1: In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 
#Jó1-2: He had seven sons and three daughters, 
#Jó1-3: and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East. 
#Jó1-4: His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
#Jó1-5: When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom. 
#Jó1-6: One day the angels "came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan "also came with them. 
#Jó1-7: The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it." 
#Jó1-8: Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil." 
#Jó1-9: "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. 
#Jó1-10: "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 
#Jó1-11: But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face." 
#Jó1-12: The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD. 
#Jó1-13: One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house, 
#Jó1-14: a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, 
#Jó1-15: and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!" 
#Jó1-16: While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!" 
#Jó1-17: While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!" 
#Jó1-18: While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house, 
#Jó1-19: when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!" 
#Jó1-20: At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship 
#Jó1-21: and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. "The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised." 
#Jó1-22: In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
 JÓ 2
#Jó2-1: On another day the angels "came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him. 
#Jó2-2: And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it." 
#Jó2-3: Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason." 
#Jó2-4: "Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life. 
#Jó2-5: But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face." 
#Jó2-6: The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life." 
#Jó2-7: So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. 
#Jó2-8: Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes. 
#Jó2-9: His wife said to him, "Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!" 
#Jó2-10: He replied, "You are talking like a foolish "woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said. 
#Jó2-11: When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him. 
#Jó2-12: When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads. 
#Jó2-13: Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.

#Jó3-1: After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 
#Jó3-2: He said: 
#Jó3-3: "May the day of my birth perish, and the night that said, 'A boy is conceived!' 
#Jó3-4: That day —may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine on it. 
#Jó3-5: May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm it. 
#Jó3-6: That night —may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months. 
#Jó3-7: May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it. 
#Jó3-8: May those who curse days "curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan. 
#Jó3-9: May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn, 
#Jó3-10: for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes. 
#Jó3-11: "Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb? 
#Jó3-12: Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed? 
#Jó3-13: For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest 
#Jó3-14: with kings and rulers of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins, 
#Jó3-15: with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. 
#Jó3-16: Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day? 
#Jó3-17: There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest. 
#Jó3-18: Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout. 
#Jó3-19: The small and the great are there, and the slaves are freed from their owners. 
#Jó3-20: "Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul, 
#Jó3-21: to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure, 
#Jó3-22: who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave? 
#Jó3-23: Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in? 
#Jó3-24: For sighing has become my daily food; my groans pour out like water. 
#Jó3-25: What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me. 
#Jó3-26: I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."

#Jó4-1: Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: 
#Jó4-2: "If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking? 
#Jó4-3: Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands. 
#Jó4-4: Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees. 
#Jó4-5: But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed. 
#Jó4-6: Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope? 
#Jó4-7: "Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed? 
#Jó4-8: As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it. 
#Jó4-9: At the breath of God they perish; at the blast of his anger they are no more. 
#Jó4-10: The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken. 
#Jó4-11: The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

#Jó4-13: Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on people,

#Jó4-15: A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end. 
#Jó4-16: It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice: 
#Jó4-17: 'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker? 
#Jó4-18: If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error, 
#Jó4-19: how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth! 
#Jó4-20: Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever. 
#Jó4-21: Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'

#Jó5-1: "Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? 
#Jó5-2: Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple. 
#Jó5-3: I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed. 
#Jó5-4: His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender. 
#Jó5-5: The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth. 
#Jó5-6: For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground. 
#Jó5-7: Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward. 
#Jó5-8: "But if I were you, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him. 
#Jó5-9: He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted. 
#Jó5-10: He provides rain for the earth; he sends water on the countryside. 
#Jó5-11: The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety. 
#Jó5-12: He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success. 
#Jó5-13: He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away. 
#Jó5-14: Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night. 
#Jó5-15: He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful. 
#Jó5-16: So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth. 
#Jó5-17: "Blessed is the one whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. [^1] 
#Jó5-18: For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal. 
#Jó5-19: From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will touch you. 
#Jó5-20: In famine he will deliver you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword. 
#Jó5-21: You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes. 
#Jó5-22: You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the wild animals. 
#Jó5-23: For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you. 
#Jó5-24: You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.

#Jó6-4: The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me. 
#Jó6-5: Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder? 
#Jó6-6: Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the sap of the mallow "? 
#Jó6-7: I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.

#Jó6-18: Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go off into the wasteland and perish. 
#Jó6-19: The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope. 
#Jó6-20: They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed. 
#Jó6-21: Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid. 
#Jó6-22: Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,

#Jó7-2: Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired laborer waiting to be paid,

#Jó7-4: When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.

#Jó7-7: Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again. 
#Jó7-8: The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.

#Jó8-3: Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?

#Jó8-14: What they trust in is fragile "; what they rely on is a spider's web. 
#Jó8-15: They lean on the web, but it gives way; they cling to it, but it does not hold.

#Jó9-3: Though they wished to dispute with him, they could not answer him one time out of a thousand. 
#Jó9-4: His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed? 
#Jó9-5: He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger. 
#Jó9-6: He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.

#Jó9-8: He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea. 
#Jó9-9: He is the Maker of the Bear "and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.

#Jó9-12: If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?' 
#Jó9-13: God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet. 
#Jó9-14: "How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him? 
#Jó9-15: Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy. 
#Jó9-16: Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing. 
#Jó9-17: He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.

#Jó15-24: Distress and anguish fill him with terror; troubles overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack, 
#Jó15-25: because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty, 
#Jó15-26: defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield. 
#Jó15-27: "Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh, 
#Jó15-28: he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble. 
#Jó15-29: He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land. 
#Jó15-30: He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away. 
#Jó15-31: Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return. 
#Jó15-32: Before his time he will wither, and his branches will not flourish. 
#Jó15-33: He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms. 
#Jó15-34: For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes. 
#Jó15-35: They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit."

#Jó16-3: Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing? 
#Jó16-4: I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you. 
#Jó16-5: But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief. 
#Jó16-6: "Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away. 
#Jó16-7: Surely, God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household. 
#Jó16-8: You have shriveled me up —and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me. 
#Jó16-9: God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes. 
#Jó16-10: People open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me. 
#Jó16-11: God has turned me over to the ungodly and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked. 
#Jó16-12: All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target; 
#Jó16-13: his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground. 
#Jó16-14: Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior. 
#Jó16-15: "I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.

#Jó17-6: "God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit. 
#Jó17-7: My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.

#Jó17-9: Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger. 
#Jó17-10: "But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you. 
#Jó17-11: My days have passed, my plans are shattered. Yet the desires of my heart

#Jó18-4: You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place? 
#Jó18-5: "The lamp of a wicked man is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning. 
#Jó18-6: The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out.

#Jó18-9: A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast. 
#Jó18-10: A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.

#Jó18-18: He is driven from light into the realm of darkness and is banished from the world. 
#Jó18-19: He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived.

#Jó19-3: Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me. 
#Jó19-4: If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone. 
#Jó19-5: If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,

#Jó19-16: I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth. 
#Jó19-17: My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own family.

#Jó20-18: What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.

#Jó21-10: Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.

#Jó24-7: Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold. 
#Jó24-8: They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.

#Jó24-11: They crush olives among the terraces "; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.

#Jó28-2: Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore. 
#Jó28-3: Mortals put an end to the darkness; they search out the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness. 
#Jó28-4: Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft, in places untouched by human feet; far from other people they dangle and sway. 
#Jó28-5: The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire; 
#Jó28-6: lapis lazuli comes from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold. 
#Jó28-7: No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it. 
#Jó28-8: Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there. 
#Jó28-9: People assault the flinty rock with their hands and lay bare the roots of the mountains. 
#Jó28-10: They tunnel through the rock; their eyes see all its treasures. 
#Jó28-11: They search "the sources of the rivers and bring hidden things to light. 
#Jó28-12: But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell? 
#Jó28-13: No mortal comprehends its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living. 
#Jó28-14: The deep says, "It is not in me"; the sea says, "It is not with me." 
#Jó28-15: It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver. 
#Jó28-16: It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or lapis lazuli. 
#Jó28-17: Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold. 
#Jó28-18: Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies. 
#Jó28-19: The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold. 
#Jó28-20: Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell? 
#Jó28-21: It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds in the sky. 
#Jó28-22: Destruction "and Death say, "Only a rumor of it has reached our ears." 
#Jó28-23: God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells, 
#Jó28-24: for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. 
#Jó28-25: When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters, 
#Jó28-26: when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm, 
#Jó28-27: then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it. 
#Jó28-28: And he said to the human race, "The fear of the Lord —that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding."

#Jó29-1: Job continued his discourse: 
#Jó29-2: "How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me, 
#Jó29-3: when his lamp shone on my head and by his light I walked through darkness! 
#Jó29-4: Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house, 
#Jó29-5: when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me, 
#Jó29-6: when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil. 
#Jó29-7: "When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square, 
#Jó29-8: the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet; 
#Jó29-9: the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands; 
#Jó29-10: the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths. 
#Jó29-11: Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me, 
#Jó29-12: because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist them. 
#Jó29-13: The one who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing. 
#Jó29-14: I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban. 
#Jó29-15: I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. 
#Jó29-16: I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger. 
#Jó29-17: I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth. 
#Jó29-18: "I thought, 'I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand. 
#Jó29-19: My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches. 
#Jó29-20: My glory will not fade; the bow will be ever new in my hand.' 
#Jó29-21: "People listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel. 
#Jó29-22: After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears. 
#Jó29-23: They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain. 
#Jó29-24: When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them. [^1] 
#Jó29-25: I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.

#Jó30-1: "But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs. 
#Jó30-2: Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them? 
#Jó30-3: Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed "the parched land in desolate wastelands at night. 
#Jó30-4: In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food "was the root of the broom bush. 
#Jó30-5: They were banished from human society, shouted at as if they were thieves. 
#Jó30-6: They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground. 
#Jó30-7: They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth. 
#Jó30-8: A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land. 
#Jó30-9: "And now those young men mock me in song; I have become a byword among them. 
#Jó30-10: They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face. 
#Jó30-11: Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence. 
#Jó30-12: On my right the tribe "attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me. 
#Jó30-13: They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me. 'No one can help him,' they say. 
#Jó30-14: They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in. 
#Jó30-15: Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud. 
#Jó30-16: "And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me. 
#Jó30-17: Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest. 
#Jó30-18: In his great power God becomes like clothing to me "; he binds me like the neck of my garment. 
#Jó30-19: He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes. 
#Jó30-20: "I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me. 
#Jó30-21: You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me. 
#Jó30-22: You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm. 
#Jó30-23: I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living. 
#Jó30-24: "Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress. 
#Jó30-25: Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor? 
#Jó30-26: Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness. 
#Jó30-27: The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me. 
#Jó30-28: I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help. 
#Jó30-29: I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls. 
#Jó30-30: My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever. 
#Jó30-31: My lyre is tuned to mourning, and my pipe to the sound of wailing.
 JÓ 31
#Jó31-1: "I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a young woman. 
#Jó31-2: For what is our lot from God above, our heritage from the Almighty on high? 
#Jó31-3: Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong? 
#Jó31-4: Does he not see my ways and count my every step? 
#Jó31-5: "If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit — 
#Jó31-6: let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless — 
#Jó31-7: if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled, 
#Jó31-8: then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted. 
#Jó31-9: "If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door, 
#Jó31-10: then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her. 
#Jó31-11: For that would have been wicked, a sin to be judged. 
#Jó31-12: It is a fire that burns to Destruction "; it would have uprooted my harvest. 
#Jó31-13: "If I have denied justice to any of my servants, whether male or female, when they had a grievance against me, 
#Jó31-14: what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account? 
#Jó31-15: Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers? 
#Jó31-16: "If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary, 
#Jó31-17: if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless — 
#Jó31-18: but from my youth I reared them as a father would, and from my birth I guided the widow — 
#Jó31-19: if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or the needy without garments, 
#Jó31-20: and their hearts did not bless me for warming them with the fleece from my sheep, 
#Jó31-21: if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court, 
#Jó31-22: then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint. 
#Jó31-23: For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things. 
#Jó31-24: "If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,' 
#Jó31-25: if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained, 
#Jó31-26: if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor, 
#Jó31-27: so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage, 
#Jó31-28: then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high. 
#Jó31-29: "If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him — 
#Jó31-30: I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against their life — 
#Jó31-31: if those of my household have never said, 'Who has not been filled with Job's meat?' — 
#Jó31-32: but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler — 
#Jó31-33: if I have concealed my sin as people do, "by hiding my guilt in my heart 
#Jó31-34: because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside — 
#Jó31-35: ("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense —let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing. 
#Jó31-36: Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown. 
#Jó31-37: I would give him an account of my every step; I would present it to him as to a ruler.) — 
#Jó31-38: "if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears, 
#Jó31-39: if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants, 
#Jó31-40: then let briers come up instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
 JÓ 32
#Jó32-1: So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
#Jó32-2: But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. 
#Jó32-3: He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him. [^1] 
#Jó32-4: Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he. 
#Jó32-5: But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused. 
#Jó32-6: So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know. 
#Jó32-7: I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.' 
#Jó32-8: But it is the spirit "in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding. 
#Jó32-9: It is not only the old "who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right. 
#Jó32-10: "Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know. 
#Jó32-11: I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words, 
#Jó32-12: I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments. 
#Jó32-13: Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God, not a man, refute him.' 
#Jó32-14: But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments. 
#Jó32-15: "They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them. 
#Jó32-16: Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply? 
#Jó32-17: I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know. 
#Jó32-18: For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me; 
#Jó32-19: inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst. 
#Jó32-20: I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply. 
#Jó32-21: I will show no partiality, nor will I flatter anyone; 
#Jó32-22: for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.
 JÓ 33
#Jó33-1: "But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say. 
#Jó33-2: I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue. 
#Jó33-3: My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know. 
#Jó33-4: The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 
#Jó33-5: Answer me then, if you can; stand up and argue your case before me. 
#Jó33-6: I am the same as you in God's sight; I too am a piece of clay. 
#Jó33-7: No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy on you. 
#Jó33-8: "But you have said in my hearing — I heard the very words — 
#Jó33-9: 'I am pure, I have done no wrong; I am clean and free from sin. 
#Jó33-10: Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy. 
#Jó33-11: He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.' 
#Jó33-12: "But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than any mortal. 
#Jó33-13: Why do you complain to him that he responds to no one's words "? 
#Jó33-14: For God does speak —now one way, now another — though no one perceives it. 
#Jó33-15: In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on people as they slumber in their beds, 
#Jó33-16: he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings, 
#Jó33-17: to turn them from wrongdoing and keep them from pride, 
#Jó33-18: to preserve them from the pit, their lives from perishing by the sword. [^2] 
#Jó33-19: "Or someone may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in their bones, 
#Jó33-20: so that their body finds food repulsive and their soul loathes the choicest meal. 
#Jó33-21: Their flesh wastes away to nothing, and their bones, once hidden, now stick out. 
#Jó33-22: They draw near to the pit, and their life to the messengers of death. [^3] 
#Jó33-23: Yet if there is an angel at their side, a messenger, one out of a thousand, sent to tell them how to be upright, 
#Jó33-24: and he is gracious to that person and says to God, 'Spare them from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for them — 
#Jó33-25: let their flesh be renewed like a child's; let them be restored as in the days of their youth' — 
#Jó33-26: then that person can pray to God and find favor with him, they will see God's face and shout for joy; he will restore them to full well-being. 
#Jó33-27: And they will go to others and say, 'I have sinned, I have perverted what is right, but I did not get what I deserved. 
#Jó33-28: God has delivered me from going down to the pit, and I shall live to enjoy the light of life.' 
#Jó33-29: "God does all these things to a person — twice, even three times — 
#Jó33-30: to turn them back from the pit, that the light of life may shine on them. 
#Jó33-31: "Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. 
#Jó33-32: If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want to vindicate you. 
#Jó33-33: But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
 JÓ 34
#Jó34-1: Then Elihu said: 
#Jó34-2: "Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning. 
#Jó34-3: For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food. 
#Jó34-4: Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good. 
#Jó34-5: "Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice. 
#Jó34-6: Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.' 
#Jó34-7: Is there anyone like Job, who drinks scorn like water? 
#Jó34-8: He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with the wicked. 
#Jó34-9: For he says, 'There is no profit in trying to please God.' 
#Jó34-10: "So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong. 
#Jó34-11: He repays everyone for what they have done; he brings on them what their conduct deserves. 
#Jó34-12: It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice. 
#Jó34-13: Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world? 
#Jó34-14: If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit "and breath, 
#Jó34-15: all humanity would perish together and mankind would return to the dust. 
#Jó34-16: "If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say. 
#Jó34-17: Can someone who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One? 
#Jó34-18: Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,' 
#Jó34-19: who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands? 
#Jó34-20: They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand. 
#Jó34-21: "His eyes are on the ways of mortals; he sees their every step. 
#Jó34-22: There is no deep shadow, no utter darkness, where evildoers can hide. 
#Jó34-23: God has no need to examine people further, that they should come before him for judgment. 
#Jó34-24: Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place. 
#Jó34-25: Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed. 
#Jó34-26: He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them, 
#Jó34-27: because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways. 
#Jó34-28: They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy. 
#Jó34-29: But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over individual and nation alike, 
#Jó34-30: to keep the godless from ruling, from laying snares for the people. 
#Jó34-31: "Suppose someone says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more. 
#Jó34-32: Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.' 
#Jó34-33: Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know. 
#Jó34-34: "Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me, 
#Jó34-35: 'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.' 
#Jó34-36: Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man! 
#Jó34-37: To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."
 JÓ 35
#Jó35-1: Then Elihu said: 
#Jó35-2: "Do you think this is just? You say, 'I am in the right, not God.' 
#Jó35-3: Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me, "and what do I gain by not sinning?' 
#Jó35-4: "I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you. 
#Jó35-5: Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you. 
#Jó35-6: If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him? 
#Jó35-7: If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand? 
#Jó35-8: Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself, and your righteousness only other people. 
#Jó35-9: "People cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful. 
#Jó35-10: But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 
#Jó35-11: who teaches us more than he teaches "the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than "the birds in the sky?' 
#Jó35-12: He does not answer when people cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked. 
#Jó35-13: Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it. 
#Jó35-14: How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him, 
#Jó35-15: and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness. [^4] 
#Jó35-16: So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."
 JÓ 36
#Jó36-1: Elihu continued: 
#Jó36-2: "Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf. 
#Jó36-3: I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker. 
#Jó36-4: Be assured that my words are not false; one who has perfect knowledge is with you. 
#Jó36-5: "God is mighty, but despises no one; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose. 
#Jó36-6: He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights. 
#Jó36-7: He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever. 
#Jó36-8: But if people are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction, 
#Jó36-9: he tells them what they have done — that they have sinned arrogantly. 
#Jó36-10: He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil. 
#Jó36-11: If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment. 
#Jó36-12: But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword "and die without knowledge. 
#Jó36-13: "The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help. 
#Jó36-14: They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines. 
#Jó36-15: But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction. 
#Jó36-16: "He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food. 
#Jó36-17: But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you. 
#Jó36-18: Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside. 
#Jó36-19: Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress? 
#Jó36-20: Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes. [^2] 
#Jó36-21: Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction. 
#Jó36-22: "God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him? 
#Jó36-23: Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, 'You have done wrong'? 
#Jó36-24: Remember to extol his work, which people have praised in song. 
#Jó36-25: All humanity has seen it; mortals gaze on it from afar. 
#Jó36-26: How great is God —beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out. 
#Jó36-27: "He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams "; 
#Jó36-28: the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind. 
#Jó36-29: Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion? 
#Jó36-30: See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea. 
#Jó36-31: This is the way he governs "the nations and provides food in abundance. 
#Jó36-32: He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark. 
#Jó36-33: His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach. [^5]
 JÓ 37
#Jó37-1: "At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place. 
#Jó37-2: Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth. 
#Jó37-3: He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth. 
#Jó37-4: After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back. 
#Jó37-5: God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding. 
#Jó37-6: He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty downpour.' 
#Jó37-7: So that everyone he has made may know his work, he stops all people from their labor. [^1] 
#Jó37-8: The animals take cover; they remain in their dens. 
#Jó37-9: The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds. 
#Jó37-10: The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen. 
#Jó37-11: He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.

#Jó42-8: So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has." 
#Jó42-9: So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer. 
#Jó42-10: After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before. 
#Jó42-11: All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver "and a gold ring.

#Sl76-10: Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained. [^2] 
#Sl76-11: Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared. 
#Sl76-12: He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.
 SALMOS 77
#Sl77-1: I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me. 
#Sl77-2: When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands, and I would not be comforted. 
#Sl77-3: I remembered you, God, and I groaned; I meditated, and my spirit grew faint. [^1] 
#Sl77-4: You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak. 
#Sl77-5: I thought about the former days, the years of long ago; 
#Sl77-6: I remembered my songs in the night. My heart meditated and my spirit asked: 
#Sl77-7: "Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again? 
#Sl77-8: Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time? 
#Sl77-9: Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?" 
#Sl77-10: Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand. 
#Sl77-11: I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago. 
#Sl77-12: I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds." 
#Sl77-13: Your ways, God, are holy. What god is as great as our God? 
#Sl77-14: You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples. 
#Sl77-15: With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. 
#Sl77-16: The waters saw you, God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed. 
#Sl77-17: The clouds poured down water, the heavens resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth. 
#Sl77-18: Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked. 
#Sl77-19: Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen. 
#Sl77-20: You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
 SALMOS 78
#Sl78-1: My people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth. 
#Sl78-2: I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old — 
#Sl78-3: things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us. 
#Sl78-4: We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done. 
#Sl78-5: He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children, 
#Sl78-6: so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children. 
#Sl78-7: Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands. 
#Sl78-8: They would not be like their ancestors — a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him. 
#Sl78-9: The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle; 
#Sl78-10: they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law. 
#Sl78-11: They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them. 
#Sl78-12: He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. 
#Sl78-13: He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand up like a wall. 
#Sl78-14: He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night. 
#Sl78-15: He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the seas; 
#Sl78-16: he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers. 
#Sl78-17: But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High. 
#Sl78-18: They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved. 
#Sl78-19: They spoke against God; they said, "Can God really spread a table in the wilderness? 
#Sl78-20: True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly, but can he also give us bread? Can he supply meat for his people?" 
#Sl78-21: When the LORD heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, 
#Sl78-22: for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance. 
#Sl78-23: Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens; 
#Sl78-24: he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven. 
#Sl78-25: Human beings ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat. 
#Sl78-26: He let loose the east wind from the heavens and by his power made the south wind blow. 
#Sl78-27: He rained meat down on them like dust, birds like sand on the seashore. 
#Sl78-28: He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents. 
#Sl78-29: They ate till they were gorged — he had given them what they craved. 
#Sl78-30: But before they turned from what they craved, even while the food was still in their mouths, 
#Sl78-31: God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel. 
#Sl78-32: In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe. 
#Sl78-33: So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror. 
#Sl78-34: Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again. 
#Sl78-35: They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer. 
#Sl78-36: But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues; 
#Sl78-37: their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant. 
#Sl78-38: Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath. 
#Sl78-39: He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return. 
#Sl78-40: How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the wasteland! 
#Sl78-41: Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel. 
#Sl78-42: They did not remember his power — the day he redeemed them from the oppressor, 
#Sl78-43: the day he displayed his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan. 
#Sl78-44: He turned their river into blood; they could not drink from their streams. 
#Sl78-45: He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them. 
#Sl78-46: He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust. 
#Sl78-47: He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet. 
#Sl78-48: He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning. 
#Sl78-49: He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility — a band of destroying angels. 
#Sl78-50: He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague. 
#Sl78-51: He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham. 
#Sl78-52: But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the wilderness. 
#Sl78-53: He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies. 
#Sl78-54: And so he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken. 
#Sl78-55: He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes. 
#Sl78-56: But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes. 
#Sl78-57: Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow. 
#Sl78-58: They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols. 
#Sl78-59: When God heard them, he was furious; he rejected Israel completely. 
#Sl78-60: He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among humans. 
#Sl78-61: He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy. 
#Sl78-62: He gave his people over to the sword; he was furious with his inheritance. 
#Sl78-63: Fire consumed their young men, and their young women had no wedding songs; 
#Sl78-64: their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep. 
#Sl78-65: Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine. 
#Sl78-66: He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame. 
#Sl78-67: Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; 
#Sl78-68: but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved. 
#Sl78-69: He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever. 
#Sl78-70: He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens; 
#Sl78-71: from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance. 
#Sl78-72: And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.
 SALMOS 79
#Sl79-1: O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble. 
#Sl79-2: They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth. 
#Sl79-3: They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead. 
#Sl79-4: We are objects of reproach to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us. 
#Sl79-5: How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire? 
#Sl79-6: Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name; 
#Sl79-7: for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland. 
#Sl79-8: Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need. 
#Sl79-9: Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake. 
#Sl79-10: Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants. 
#Sl79-11: May the groans of the prisoners come before you; by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die. 
#Sl79-12: Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you, O Lord. 
#Sl79-13: Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.
 SALMOS 80
#Sl80-1: Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth

#Sl80-3: Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved. 
#Sl80-4: How long, LORD God Almighty, will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?

#Sl80-9: You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land. 
#Sl80-10: The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. 
#Sl80-11: Its branches reached as far as the Sea, "its shoots as far as the River. [^3] 
#Sl80-12: Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes? 
#Sl80-13: Boars from the forest ravage it, and insects from the fields feed on it. 
#Sl80-14: Return to us, God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine, 
#Sl80-15: the root your right hand has planted, the son "you have raised up for yourself. 
#Sl80-16: Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish. 
#Sl80-17: Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself. 
#Sl80-18: Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.

#Sl81-4: this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 
#Sl81-5: When God went out against Egypt, he established it as a statute for Joseph. I heard an unknown voice say: 
#Sl81-6: "I removed the burden from their shoulders; their hands were set free from the basket. 
#Sl81-7: In your distress you called and I rescued you, I answered you out of a thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. [^1]

#Sl81-9: You shall have no foreign god among you; you shall not worship any god other than me.

#Sl81-13: "If my people would only listen to me, if Israel would only follow my ways, 
#Sl81-14: how quickly I would subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes! 
#Sl81-15: Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.

#Sl83-4: "Come," they say, "let us destroy them as a nation, so that Israel's name is remembered no more."

#Sl83-12: who said, "Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God." 
#Sl83-13: Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like chaff before the wind. 
#Sl83-14: As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze,

#Sl88-11: Is your love declared in the grave, your faithfulness in Destruction "? 
#Sl88-12: Are your wonders known in the place of darkness, or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?

#Pv31-9: Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy. 
#Pv31-10: A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. 
#Pv31-11: Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. 
#Pv31-12: She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. 
#Pv31-13: She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. 
#Pv31-14: She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. 
#Pv31-15: She gets up while it is still night; she provides food for her family and portions for her female servants. 
#Pv31-16: She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. 
#Pv31-17: She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. 
#Pv31-18: She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. 
#Pv31-19: In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. 
#Pv31-20: She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. 
#Pv31-21: When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. 
#Pv31-22: She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. 
#Pv31-23: Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. 
#Pv31-24: She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. 
#Pv31-25: She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. 
#Pv31-26: She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. 
#Pv31-27: She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. 
#Pv31-28: Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: 
#Pv31-29: "Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all." 
#Pv31-30: Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. 
#Pv31-31: Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
ECLESIASTES
 ECLESIASTES 1
#Ec1-1: The words of the Teacher, "son of David, king in Jerusalem: 
#Ec1-2: "Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless." 
#Ec1-3: What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil under the sun? 
#Ec1-4: Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever. 
#Ec1-5: The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises. 
#Ec1-6: The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course. 
#Ec1-7: All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again. 
#Ec1-8: All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing. 
#Ec1-9: What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. 
#Ec1-10: Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time. 
#Ec1-11: No one remembers the former generations, and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them. 
#Ec1-12: I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
#Ec1-13: I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! 
#Ec1-14: I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 
#Ec1-15: What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted. 
#Ec1-16: I said to myself, "Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge." 
#Ec1-17: Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. 
#Ec1-18: For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.
 ECLESIASTES 2
#Ec2-1: I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless. 
#Ec2-2: "Laughter," I said, "is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?" 
#Ec2-3: I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly —my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives. 
#Ec2-4: I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. 
#Ec2-5: I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 
#Ec2-6: I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. 
#Ec2-7: I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. 
#Ec2-8: I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem "as well —the delights of a man's heart. 
#Ec2-9: I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me. 
#Ec2-10: I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my labor, and this was the reward for all my toil. 
#Ec2-11: Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun. 
#Ec2-12: Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done? 
#Ec2-13: I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness. 
#Ec2-14: The wise have eyes in their heads, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both. 
#Ec2-15: Then I said to myself, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said to myself, "This too is meaningless." 
#Ec2-16: For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered; the days have already come when both have been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die! 
#Ec2-17: So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 
#Ec2-18: I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. 
#Ec2-19: And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. 
#Ec2-20: So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. 
#Ec2-21: For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. 
#Ec2-22: What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? 
#Ec2-23: All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless. 
#Ec2-24: A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, 
#Ec2-25: for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment? 
#Ec2-26: To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
 ECLESIASTES 3
#Ec3-1: There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: 
#Ec3-2: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, 
#Ec3-3: a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, 
#Ec3-4: a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, 
#Ec3-5: a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, 
#Ec3-6: a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, 
#Ec3-7: a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, 
#Ec3-8: a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. 
#Ec3-9: What do workers gain from their toil? 
#Ec3-10: I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. 
#Ec3-11: He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet "no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. 
#Ec3-12: I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. 
#Ec3-13: That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil —this is the gift of God. 
#Ec3-14: I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him. 
#Ec3-15: Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account. [^2] 
#Ec3-16: And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment —wickedness was there, in the place of justice —wickedness was there. 
#Ec3-17: I said to myself, "God will bring into judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time to judge every deed." 
#Ec3-18: I also said to myself, "As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. 
#Ec3-19: Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath "; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless. 
#Ec3-20: All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return. 
#Ec3-21: Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?" 
#Ec3-22: So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?
 ECLESIASTES 4
#Ec4-1: Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed — and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors — and they have no comforter. 
#Ec4-2: And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. 
#Ec4-3: But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun. 
#Ec4-4: And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person's envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 
#Ec4-5: Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves. 
#Ec4-6: Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind. 
#Ec4-7: Again I saw something meaningless under the sun: 
#Ec4-8: There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless — a miserable business! 
#Ec4-9: Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: 
#Ec4-10: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. 
#Ec4-11: Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? 
#Ec4-12: Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. 
#Ec4-13: Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning. 
#Ec4-14: The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom. 
#Ec4-15: I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor. 
#Ec4-16: There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
 ECLESIASTES 5
#Ec5-1: Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong. 
#Ec5-2: Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few. 
#Ec5-3: A dream comes when there are many cares, and many words mark the speech of a fool. 
#Ec5-4: When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. 
#Ec5-5: It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it. 
#Ec5-6: Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, "My vow was a mistake." Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands? 
#Ec5-7: Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God. 
#Ec5-8: If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still. 
#Ec5-9: The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields. 
#Ec5-10: Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless. 
#Ec5-11: As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them? 
#Ec5-12: The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much, but as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep. 
#Ec5-13: I have seen a grievous evil under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners, 
#Ec5-14: or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when they have children there is nothing left for them to inherit. 
#Ec5-15: Everyone comes naked from their mother's womb, and as everyone comes, so they depart. They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands. 
#Ec5-16: This too is a grievous evil: As everyone comes, so they depart, and what do they gain, since they toil for the wind? 
#Ec5-17: All their days they eat in darkness, with great frustration, affliction and anger. 
#Ec5-18: This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them —for this is their lot. 
#Ec5-19: Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil —this is a gift of God. 
#Ec5-20: They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart.
 ECLESIASTES 6
#Ec6-1: I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on mankind: 
#Ec6-2: God gives some people wealth, possessions and honor, so that they lack nothing their hearts desire, but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them, and strangers enjoy them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil. 
#Ec6-3: A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he. 
#Ec6-4: It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded. 
#Ec6-5: Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man — 
#Ec6-6: even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place? 
#Ec6-7: Everyone's toil is for their mouth, yet their appetite is never satisfied. 
#Ec6-8: What advantage have the wise over fools? What do the poor gain by knowing how to conduct themselves before others? 
#Ec6-9: Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 
#Ec6-10: Whatever exists has already been named, and what humanity is has been known; no one can contend with someone who is stronger. 
#Ec6-11: The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone? 
#Ec6-12: For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and meaningless days they pass through like a shadow? Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they are gone?
 ECLESIASTES 7
#Ec7-1: A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth. 
#Ec7-2: It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of everyone; the living should take this to heart. 
#Ec7-3: Frustration is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart. 
#Ec7-4: The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure. 
#Ec7-5: It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person than to listen to the song of fools. 
#Ec7-6: Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless. 
#Ec7-7: Extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart. 
#Ec7-8: The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride. 
#Ec7-9: Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools. 
#Ec7-10: Do not say, "Why were the old days better than these?" For it is not wise to ask such questions. 
#Ec7-11: Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun. 
#Ec7-12: Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves those who have it. 
#Ec7-13: Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked? 
#Ec7-14: When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider this: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, no one can discover anything about their future. 
#Ec7-15: In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: the righteous perishing in their righteousness, and the wicked living long in their wickedness. 
#Ec7-16: Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise — why destroy yourself? 
#Ec7-17: Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool — why die before your time? 
#Ec7-18: It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes. [^1] 
#Ec7-19: Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful than ten rulers in a city. 
#Ec7-20: Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins. 
#Ec7-21: Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you — 
#Ec7-22: for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others. 
#Ec7-23: All this I tested by wisdom and I said, "I am determined to be wise" — but this was beyond me. 
#Ec7-24: Whatever exists is far off and most profound — who can discover it? 
#Ec7-25: So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly. 
#Ec7-26: I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare. 
#Ec7-27: "Look," says the Teacher, ""this is what I have discovered: "Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things — 
#Ec7-28: while I was still searching but not finding — I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all. 
#Ec7-29: This only have I found: God created mankind upright, but they have gone in search of many schemes."
 ECLESIASTES 8
#Ec8-1: Who is like the wise? Who knows the explanation of things? A person's wisdom brightens their face and changes its hard appearance. 
#Ec8-2: Obey the king's command, I say, because you took an oath before God. 
#Ec8-3: Do not be in a hurry to leave the king's presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases. 
#Ec8-4: Since a king's word is supreme, who can say to him, "What are you doing?" 
#Ec8-5: Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure. 
#Ec8-6: For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a person may be weighed down by misery. 
#Ec8-7: Since no one knows the future, who can tell someone else what is to come? 
#Ec8-8: As no one has power over the wind to contain it, so "no one has power over the time of their death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it. 
#Ec8-9: All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own "hurt. 
#Ec8-10: Then too, I saw the wicked buried —those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise "in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless. 
#Ec8-11: When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people's hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong. 
#Ec8-12: Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time, I know that it will go better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him. 
#Ec8-13: Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow. 
#Ec8-14: There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless. 
#Ec8-15: So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun. 
#Ec8-16: When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth —people getting no sleep day or night — 
#Ec8-17: then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it.
 ECLESIASTES 9
#Ec9-1: So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them. 
#Ec9-2: All share a common destiny —the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, "the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good, so with the sinful; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them. 
#Ec9-3: This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead. 
#Ec9-4: Anyone who is among the living has hope "—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion! 
#Ec9-5: For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their name is forgotten. 
#Ec9-6: Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun. 
#Ec9-7: Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do. 
#Ec9-8: Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil. 
#Ec9-9: Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun —all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun. 
#Ec9-10: Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom. 
#Ec9-11: I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all. 
#Ec9-12: Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so people are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them. 
#Ec9-13: I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me: 
#Ec9-14: There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. 
#Ec9-15: Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man. 
#Ec9-16: So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded. 
#Ec9-17: The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools. 
#Ec9-18: Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
 ECLESIASTES 10
#Ec10-1: As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 
#Ec10-2: The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left. 
#Ec10-3: Even as fools walk along the road, they lack sense and show everyone how stupid they are. 
#Ec10-4: If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great offenses to rest. 
#Ec10-5: There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler: 
#Ec10-6: Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones. 
#Ec10-7: I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves. 
#Ec10-8: Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. 
#Ec10-9: Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them. 
#Ec10-10: If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed, but skill will bring success. 
#Ec10-11: If a snake bites before it is charmed, the charmer receives no fee. 
#Ec10-12: Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious, but fools are consumed by their own lips. 
#Ec10-13: At the beginning their words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness — 
#Ec10-14: and fools multiply words. No one knows what is coming — who can tell someone else what will happen after them? 
#Ec10-15: The toil of fools wearies them; they do not know the way to town. 
#Ec10-16: Woe to the land whose king was a servant "and whose princes feast in the morning. 
#Ec10-17: Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time — for strength and not for drunkenness. 
#Ec10-18: Through laziness, the rafters sag; because of idle hands, the house leaks. 
#Ec10-19: A feast is made for laughter, wine makes life merry, and money is the answer for everything. 
#Ec10-20: Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird in the sky may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.
 ECLESIASTES 11
#Ec11-1: Ship your grain across the sea; after many days you may receive a return. 
#Ec11-2: Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight; you do not know what disaster may come upon the land. 
#Ec11-3: If clouds are full of water, they pour rain on the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there it will lie. 
#Ec11-4: Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap. 
#Ec11-5: As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed "in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things. 
#Ec11-6: Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let your hands not be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well. 
#Ec11-7: Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun. 
#Ec11-8: However many years anyone may live, let them enjoy them all. But let them remember the days of darkness, for there will be many. Everything to come is meaningless. 
#Ec11-9: You who are young, be happy while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment. 
#Ec11-10: So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.
 ECLESIASTES 12
#Ec12-1: Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, "I find no pleasure in them" — 
#Ec12-2: before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain; 
#Ec12-3: when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim; 
#Ec12-4: when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when people rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint; 
#Ec12-5: when people are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags itself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets. 
#Ec12-6: Remember him —before the silver cord is severed, and the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, and the wheel broken at the well, 
#Ec12-7: and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. 
#Ec12-8: "Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. ""Everything is meaningless!" 
#Ec12-9: Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs. 
#Ec12-10: The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true. 
#Ec12-11: The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails —given by one shepherd. [^2] 
#Ec12-12: Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body. 
#Ec12-13: Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. 
#Ec12-14: For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.

#Is1-3: The ox knows its master, the donkey its owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand." 
#Is1-4: Woe to the sinful nation, a people whose guilt is great, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. 
#Is1-5: Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. 
#Is1-6: From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness — only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with olive oil. 
#Is1-7: Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. 
#Is1-8: Daughter Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under siege. 
#Is1-9: Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.

#Is1-11: "The multitude of your sacrifices — what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. 
#Is1-12: When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? 
#Is1-13: Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations — I cannot bear your worthless assemblies. 
#Is1-14: Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. 
#Is1-15: When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood! 
#Is1-16: Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong.

#Is1-22: Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.

#Is2-5: Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD. 
#Is2-6: You, LORD, have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and embrace pagan customs. 
#Is2-7: Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.

#Is5-20: Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. 
#Is5-21: Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight. 
#Is5-22: Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks, 
#Is5-23: who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent. 
#Is5-24: Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
#Is5-25: Therefore the LORD's anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. 
#Is5-26: He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily! 
#Is5-27: Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal strap is broken. 
#Is5-28: Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses' hooves seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind. 
#Is5-29: Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue. 
#Is5-30: In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, there is only darkness and distress; even the sun will be darkened by clouds.
 ISAÍAS 6
#Is6-1: In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. 
#Is6-2: Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. 
#Is6-3: And they were calling to one another: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory." 
#Is6-4: At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke. 
#Is6-5: "Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty." 
#Is6-6: Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. 
#Is6-7: With it he touched my mouth and said, "See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for." 
#Is6-8: Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!" 
#Is6-9: He said, "Go and tell this people: "'Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.' 
#Is6-10: Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. "Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed." 
#Is6-11: Then I said, "For how long, Lord?" And he answered: "Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged, 
#Is6-12: until the LORD has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken. 
#Is6-13: And though a tenth remains in the land, it will again be laid waste. But as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump in the land."
 ISAÍAS 7
#Is7-1: When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it. 
#Is7-2: Now the house of David was told, "Aram has allied itself with "Ephraim"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.

#Is7-5: Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son have plotted your ruin, saying, 
#Is7-6: "Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it." 
#Is7-7: Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'It will not take place, it will not happen, 
#Is7-8: for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. 
#Is7-9: The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.'" 
#Is7-10: Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, 
#Is7-11: "Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights." 
#Is7-12: But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test." 
#Is7-13: Then Isaiah said, "Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also?

#Is7-16: for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. 
#Is7-17: The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah —he will bring the king of Assyria." 
#Is7-18: In that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the Nile delta in Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria. 
#Is7-19: They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.

#Is7-21: In that day, a person will keep alive a young cow and two goats. 
#Is7-22: And because of the abundance of the milk they give, there will be curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.

#Is7-24: Hunters will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns. 
#Is7-25: As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.

#Is8-3: Then I made love to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. 
#Is8-4: For before the boy knows how to say 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria." 
#Is8-5: The LORD spoke to me again: 
#Is8-6: "Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah, 
#Is8-7: therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates — the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks 
#Is8-8: and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, Immanuel "!" 
#Is8-9: Raise the war cry, "you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered!

#Is8-11: This is what the LORD says to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people: 
#Is8-12: "Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls a conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it. 
#Is8-13: The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread. 
#Is8-14: He will be a holy place; for both Israel and Judah he will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare. 
#Is8-15: Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured." 
#Is8-16: Bind up this testimony of warning and seal up God's instruction among my disciples. 
#Is8-17: I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob. I will put my trust in him. 
#Is8-18: Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion. 
#Is8-19: When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? 
#Is8-20: Consult God's instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn. 
#Is8-21: Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God. 
#Is8-22: Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.

#Is9-20: On the right they will devour, but still be hungry; on the left they will eat, but not be satisfied. Each will feed on the flesh of their own offspring ": 
#Is9-21: Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh; together they will turn against Judah. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.

#Is27-3: I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it. 
#Is27-4: I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire. 
#Is27-5: Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me." 
#Is27-6: In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit. 
#Is27-7: Has the LORD struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her? 
#Is27-8: By warfare "and exile you contend with her — with his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows. 
#Is27-9: By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like limestone crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles "or incense altars will be left standing. 
#Is27-10: The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the wilderness; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare. 
#Is27-11: When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor. 
#Is27-12: In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, Israel, will be gathered up one by one. 
#Is27-13: And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
 ISAÍAS 28
#Is28-1: Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley — to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine! 
#Is28-2: See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground. 
#Is28-3: That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, will be trampled underfoot. 
#Is28-4: That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like figs ripe before harvest — as soon as people see them and take them in hand, they swallow them. 
#Is28-5: In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people. 
#Is28-6: He will be a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. 
#Is28-7: And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions. 
#Is28-8: All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth. 
#Is28-9: "Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast? 
#Is28-10: For it is: Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that "; a little here, a little there." 
#Is28-11: Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people, 
#Is28-12: to whom he said, "This is the resting place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is the place of repose" — but they would not listen. 
#Is28-13: So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do this, do that, a rule for this, a rule for that; a little here, a little there — so that as they go they will fall backward; they will be injured and snared and captured. 
#Is28-14: Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem. 
#Is28-15: You boast, "We have entered into a covenant with death, with the realm of the dead we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood "our hiding place." 
#Is28-16: So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic. 
#Is28-17: I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place. 
#Is28-18: Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the realm of the dead will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it. 
#Is28-19: As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through." The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror. 
#Is28-20: The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you. 
#Is28-21: The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon — to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task. 
#Is28-22: Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land. 
#Is28-23: Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say. 
#Is28-24: When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil? 
#Is28-25: When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, "barley in its plot, "and spelt in its field? 
#Is28-26: His God instructs him and teaches him the right way. 
#Is28-27: Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cumin with a stick. 
#Is28-28: Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. The wheels of a threshing cart may be rolled over it, but one does not use horses to grind grain. 
#Is28-29: All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, whose plan is wonderful, whose wisdom is magnificent.
 ISAÍAS 29
#Is29-1: Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David settled! Add year to year and let your cycle of festivals go on. 
#Is29-2: Yet I will besiege Ariel; she will mourn and lament, she will be to me like an altar hearth. 
#Is29-3: I will encamp against you all around; I will encircle you with towers and set up my siege works against you. 
#Is29-4: Brought low, you will speak from the ground; your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth; out of the dust your speech will whisper. 
#Is29-5: But your many enemies will become like fine dust, the ruthless hordes like blown chaff. Suddenly, in an instant, 
#Is29-6: the LORD Almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire. 
#Is29-7: Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel, that attack her and her fortress and besiege her, will be as it is with a dream, with a vision in the night- 
#Is29-8: as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating, but he awakens, and his hunger remains; as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he awakens faint, with his thirst unquenched. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion. 
#Is29-9: Be stunned and amazed, blind yourselves and be sightless; be drunk, but not from wine, stagger, but not from beer. 
#Is29-10: The LORD has brought over you a deep sleep: He has sealed your eyes (the prophets); he has covered your heads (the seers). 
#Is29-11: For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say to him, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I can't; it is sealed." 
#Is29-12: Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I don't know how to read." 
#Is29-13: The Lord says: "These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men. 
#Is29-14: Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish." 
#Is29-15: Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the LORD, who do their work in darkness and think, "Who sees us? Who will know?" 
#Is29-16: You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, "He did not make me"? Can the pot say of the potter, "He knows nothing"? 
#Is29-17: In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest? 
#Is29-18: In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. 
#Is29-19: Once more the humble will rejoice in the LORD; the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 
#Is29-20: The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down- 
#Is29-21: those who with a word make a man out to be guilty, who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice. 
#Is29-22: Therefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the house of Jacob: "No longer will Jacob be ashamed; no longer will their faces grow pale. 
#Is29-23: When they see among them their children, the work of my hands, they will keep my name holy; they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel. 
#Is29-24: Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding; those who complain will accept instruction."
 ISAÍAS 30
#Is30-1: "Woe to the obstinate children," declares the LORD, "to those who carry out plans that are not mine, forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping sin upon sin; 
#Is30-2: who go down to Egypt without consulting me; who look for help to Pharaoh's protection, to Egypt's shade for refuge. 
#Is30-3: But Pharaoh's protection will be to your shame, Egypt's shade will bring you disgrace. 
#Is30-4: Though they have officials in Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes, 
#Is30-5: everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them, who bring neither help nor advantage, but only shame and disgrace." 
#Is30-6: A prophecy concerning the animals of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, of lions and lionesses, of adders and darting snakes, the envoys carry their riches on donkeys' backs, their treasures on the humps of camels, to that unprofitable nation, 
#Is30-7: to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing. 
#Is30-8: Go now, write it on a tablet for them, inscribe it on a scroll, that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness. 
#Is30-9: For these are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the LORD's instruction. 
#Is30-10: They say to the seers, "See no more visions!" and to the prophets, "Give us no more visions of what is right! Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions.

#Is30-12: Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says: "Because you have rejected this message, relied on oppression and depended on deceit, 
#Is30-13: this sin will become for you like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant.

#Is30-16: You said, 'No, we will flee on horses.' Therefore you will flee! You said, 'We will ride off on swift horses.' Therefore your pursuers will be swift! 
#Is30-17: A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee away, till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill." 
#Is30-18: Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you; therefore he will rise up to show you compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him! 
#Is30-19: People of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. 
#Is30-20: Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. 
#Is30-21: Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way; walk in it." 
#Is30-22: Then you will desecrate your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, "Away with you!" 
#Is30-23: He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows.

#Is30-27: See, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is a consuming fire. 
#Is30-28: His breath is like a rushing torrent, rising up to the neck. He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction; he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray. 
#Is30-29: And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people playing pipes go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. 
#Is30-30: The LORD will cause people to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.

 ISAÍAS 31
#Is31-1: Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel, or seek help from the LORD. 
#Is31-2: Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster; he does not take back his words. He will rise up against that wicked nation, against those who help evildoers.

#Is31-4: This is what the LORD says to me: "As a lion growls, a great lion over its prey — and though a whole band of shepherds is called together against it, it is not frightened by their shouts or disturbed by their clamor — so the LORD Almighty will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights. 
#Is31-5: Like birds hovering overhead, the LORD Almighty will shield Jerusalem; he will shield it and deliver it, he will 'pass over' it and will rescue it."

 ISAÍAS 32
#Is32-1: See, a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice. 
#Is32-2: Each one will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land. 
#Is32-3: Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen. 
#Is32-4: The fearful heart will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear. 
#Is32-5: No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.

#Is32-9: You women who are so complacent, rise up and listen to me; you daughters who feel secure, hear what I have to say! 
#Is32-10: In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble; the grape harvest will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not come. 
#Is32-11: Tremble, you complacent women; shudder, you daughters who feel secure! Strip off your fine clothes and wrap yourselves in rags. 
#Is32-12: Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines 
#Is32-13: and for the land of my people, a land overgrown with thorns and briers — yes, mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry. 
#Is32-14: The fortress will be abandoned, the noisy city deserted; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks, 
#Is32-15: till the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the desert becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field seems like a forest. 
#Is32-16: The LORD's justice will dwell in the desert, his righteousness live in the fertile field. 
#Is32-17: The fruit of that righteousness will be peace; its effect will be quietness and confidence forever. 
#Is32-18: My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest. 
#Is32-19: Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely, 
#Is32-20: how blessed you will be, sowing your seed by every stream, and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.
 ISAÍAS 33

#Is33-7: Look, their brave men cry aloud in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly. 
#Is33-8: The highways are deserted, no travelers are on the roads. The treaty is broken, its witnesses "are despised, no one is respected.

#Is33-10: "Now will I arise," says the LORD. "Now will I be exalted; now will I be lifted up. 
#Is33-11: You conceive chaff, you give birth to straw; your breath is a fire that consumes you.

#Is33-13: You who are far away, hear what I have done; you who are near, acknowledge my power! 
#Is33-14: The sinners in Zion are terrified; trembling grips the godless: "Who of us can dwell with the consuming fire? Who of us can dwell with everlasting burning?" 
#Is33-15: Those who walk righteously and speak what is right, who reject gain from extortion and keep their hands from accepting bribes, who stop their ears against plots of murder and shut their eyes against contemplating evil — 
#Is33-16: they are the ones who will dwell on the heights, whose refuge will be the mountain fortress. Their bread will be supplied, and water will not fail them. 
#Is33-17: Your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view a land that stretches afar. 
#Is33-18: In your thoughts you will ponder the former terror: "Where is that chief officer? Where is the one who took the revenue? Where is the officer in charge of the towers?" 
#Is33-19: You will see those arrogant people no more, people whose speech is obscure, whose language is strange and incomprehensible. 
#Is33-20: Look on Zion, the city of our festivals; your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful abode, a tent that will not be moved; its stakes will never be pulled up, nor any of its ropes broken. 
#Is33-21: There the LORD will be our Mighty One. It will be like a place of broad rivers and streams. No galley with oars will ride them, no mighty ship will sail them. 
#Is33-22: For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; it is he who will save us. 
#Is33-23: Your rigging hangs loose: The mast is not held secure, the sail is not spread. Then an abundance of spoils will be divided and even the lame will carry off plunder. 
#Is33-24: No one living in Zion will say, "I am ill"; and the sins of those who dwell there will be forgiven.
 ISAÍAS 34

#Is34-7: And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat.

#Is34-12: Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom, all her princes will vanish away. 
#Is34-13: Thorns will overrun her citadels, nettles and brambles her strongholds. She will become a haunt for jackals, a home for owls. 
#Is34-14: Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and wild goats will bleat to each other; there the night creatures will also lie down and find for themselves places of rest. 
#Is34-15: The owl will nest there and lay eggs, she will hatch them, and care for her young under the shadow of her wings; there also the falcons will gather, each with its mate.

 ISAÍAS 35
#Is35-1: The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus,

#Is35-3: Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way; 
#Is35-4: say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you." 
#Is35-5: Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. 
#Is35-6: Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.

#Is35-8: And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness; it will be for those who walk on that Way. The unclean will not journey on it; wicked fools will not go about on it. 
#Is35-9: No lion will be there, nor any ravenous beast; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there, 
#Is35-10: and those the LORD has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
 ISAÍAS 36
#Is36-1: In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
#Is36-2: Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer's Field, 
#Is36-3: Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him. 
#Is36-4: The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah: "'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? 
#Is36-5: You say you have counsel and might for war —but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? 
#Is36-6: Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. 
#Is36-7: But if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God" —isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar"? 
#Is36-8: "'Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses —if you can put riders on them! 
#Is36-9: How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen "? 
#Is36-10: Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'" 
#Is36-11: Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall." 
#Is36-12: But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall —who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?"

#Is44-9: All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame.

#Is44-12: The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.

#Is44-19: No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, "Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?"

#Is44-26: who carries out the words of his servants and fulfills the predictions of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, 'It shall be inhabited,' of the towns of Judah, 'They shall be rebuilt,' and of their ruins, 'I will restore them,' 
#Is44-27: who says to the watery deep, 'Be dry, and I will dry up your streams,' 
#Is44-28: who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, "Let it be rebuilt," and of the temple, "Let its foundations be laid."'

#Is45-9: "Woe to those who quarrel with their Maker, those who are nothing but potsherds among the potsherds on the ground. Does the clay say to the potter, 'What are you making?' Does your work say, 'The potter has no hands'?

#Is50-2: When I came, why was there no one? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Was my arm too short to deliver you? Do I lack the strength to rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.

 ISAÍAS 51

#Is52-15: so he will sprinkle many nations, "and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand.
 ISAÍAS 53
#Is53-1: Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?

 ISAÍAS 54

#Is56-5: to them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever. 
#Is56-6: And foreigners who bind themselves to the LORD to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be his servants, all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant —

#Is57-3: "But you —come here, you children of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes! 
#Is57-4: Who are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars? 
#Is57-5: You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags. 
#Is57-6: The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; indeed, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In view of all this, should I relent? 
#Is57-7: You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices. 
#Is57-8: Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked with lust on their naked bodies.

#Is57-13: When you cry out for help, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry all of them off, a mere breath will blow them away. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain."

#Is58-2: For day after day they seek me out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come near them. 
#Is58-3: 'Why have we fasted,' they say, 'and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?' "Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please and exploit all your workers. 
#Is58-4: Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high. 
#Is58-5: Is this the kind of fast I have chosen, only a day for people to humble themselves? Is it only for bowing one's head like a reed and for lying in sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD? 
#Is58-6: "Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? 
#Is58-7: Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter — when you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood? 
#Is58-8: Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness "will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. 
#Is58-9: Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I. "If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk,

#Is58-14: then you will find your joy in the LORD, and I will cause you to ride in triumph on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
 ISAÍAS 59
#Is59-1: Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. 
#Is59-2: But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. 
#Is59-3: For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken falsely, and your tongue mutters wicked things. 
#Is59-4: No one calls for justice; no one pleads a case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil. 
#Is59-5: They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched. 
#Is59-6: Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands. 
#Is59-7: Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. They pursue evil schemes; acts of violence mark their ways. 
#Is59-8: The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks along them will know peace. 
#Is59-9: So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows. 
#Is59-10: Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like people without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead. 
#Is59-11: We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away. 
#Is59-12: For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities: 
#Is59-13: rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, inciting revolt and oppression, uttering lies our hearts have conceived. 
#Is59-14: So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter. 
#Is59-15: Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice. 
#Is59-16: He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm achieved salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him. 
#Is59-17: He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak. 
#Is59-18: According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due. 
#Is59-19: From the west, people will fear the name of the LORD, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the LORD drives along. [^1] 
#Is59-20: "The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins," declares the LORD. 
#Is59-21: "As for me, this is my covenant with them," says the LORD. "My Spirit, who is on you, will not depart from you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will always be on your lips, on the lips of your children and on the lips of their descendants —from this time on and forever," says the LORD.

#Is60-15: "Although you have been forsaken and hated, with no one traveling through, I will make you the everlasting pride and the joy of all generations. 
#Is60-16: You will drink the milk of nations and be nursed at royal breasts. Then you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. 
#Is60-17: Instead of bronze I will bring you gold, and silver in place of iron. Instead of wood I will bring you bronze, and iron in place of stones. I will make peace your governor and well-being your ruler. 
#Is60-18: No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise. 
#Is60-19: The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.

 ISAÍAS 61
#Is61-1: The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, [^1] 
#Is61-2: to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, 
#Is61-3: and provide for those who grieve in Zion — to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his splendor.

 ISAÍAS 63

#Is63-2: Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? 
#Is63-3: "I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing. 
#Is63-4: It was for me the day of vengeance; the year for me to redeem had come.

#Is63-11: Then his people recalled "the days of old, the days of Moses and his people — where is he who brought them through the sea, with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who set his Holy Spirit among them, 
#Is63-12: who sent his glorious arm of power to be at Moses' right hand, who divided the waters before them, to gain for himself everlasting renown, 
#Is63-13: who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble;

#Is64-6: All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away. 
#Is64-7: No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and have given us over to "our sins. 
#Is64-8: Yet you, LORD, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand. 
#Is64-9: Do not be angry beyond measure, LORD; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look on us, we pray, for we are all your people. 
#Is64-10: Your sacred cities have become a wasteland; even Zion is a wasteland, Jerusalem a desolation. 
#Is64-11: Our holy and glorious temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned with fire, and all that we treasured lies in ruins. 
#Is64-12: After all this, LORD, will you hold yourself back? Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure?
 ISAÍAS 65
#Is65-1: "I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me; I was found by those who did not seek me. To a nation that did not call on my name, I said, 'Here am I, here am I.' 
#Is65-2: All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations — 
#Is65-3: a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick; 
#Is65-4: who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; who eat the flesh of pigs, and whose pots hold broth of impure meat; 
#Is65-5: who say, 'Keep away; don't come near me, for I am too sacred for you!' Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day. 
#Is65-6: "See, it stands written before me: I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps — 
#Is65-7: both your sins and the sins of your ancestors," says the LORD. "Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills, I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds." 
#Is65-8: This is what the LORD says: "As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and people say, 'Don't destroy it, there is still a blessing in it,' so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all. 
#Is65-9: I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains; my chosen people will inherit them, and there will my servants live. 
#Is65-10: Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me. 
#Is65-11: "But as for you who forsake the LORD and forget my holy mountain, who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny, 
#Is65-12: I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will fall in the slaughter; for I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me." 
#Is65-13: Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame. 
#Is65-14: My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit. 
#Is65-15: You will leave your name for my chosen ones to use in their curses; the Sovereign LORD will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name. 
#Is65-16: Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the one true God; whoever takes an oath in the land will swear by the one true God. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes. 
#Is65-17: "See, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind. 
#Is65-18: But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy. 
#Is65-19: I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more. 
#Is65-20: "Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child; the one who fails to reach "a hundred will be considered accursed. 
#Is65-21: They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
#Is65-22: No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands. 
#Is65-23: They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the LORD, they and their descendants with them. 
#Is65-24: Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear. 
#Is65-25: The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain," says the LORD.
 ISAÍAS 66
#Is66-1: This is what the LORD says: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my resting place be? 
#Is66-2: Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came into being?" declares the LORD. "These are the ones I look on with favor: those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at my word. 
#Is66-3: But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a person, and whoever offers a lamb is like one who breaks a dog's neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig's blood, and whoever burns memorial incense is like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and they delight in their abominations; 
#Is66-4: so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring on them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me." 
#Is66-5: Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: "Your own people who hate you, and exclude you because of my name, have said, 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy!' Yet they will be put to shame. 
#Is66-6: Hear that uproar from the city, hear that noise from the temple! It is the sound of the LORD repaying his enemies all they deserve. 
#Is66-7: "Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son. 
#Is66-8: Who has ever heard of such things? Who has ever seen things like this? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children. 
#Is66-9: Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?" says the LORD. "Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?" says your God. 
#Is66-10: "Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her. 
#Is66-11: For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance." 
#Is66-12: For this is what the LORD says: "I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees. 
#Is66-13: As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem." 
#Is66-14: When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes. 
#Is66-15: See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. 
#Is66-16: For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment on all people, and many will be those slain by the LORD. 
#Is66-17: "Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one who is among those who eat the flesh of pigs, rats and other unclean things —they will meet their end together with the one they follow," declares the LORD. 
#Is66-18: "And I, because of what they have planned and done, am about to come "and gather the people of all nations and languages, and they will come and see my glory. 
#Is66-19: "I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations —to Tarshish, to the Libyans "and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations. 
#Is66-20: And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD —on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels," says the LORD. "They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels. 
#Is66-21: And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites," says the LORD. 
#Is66-22: "As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me," declares the LORD, "so will your name and descendants endure. 
#Is66-23: From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me," says the LORD. 
#Is66-24: "And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."
JEREMIAS
 JEREMIAS 1
#Jr1-1: The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. 
#Jr1-2: The word of the LORD came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, 
#Jr1-3: and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile. 
#Jr1-4: The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
#Jr1-5: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew "you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations." 
#Jr1-6: "Alas, Sovereign LORD," I said, "I do not know how to speak; I am too young." 
#Jr1-7: But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am too young.' You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. 
#Jr1-8: Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the LORD. 
#Jr1-9: Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, "I have put my words in your mouth. 
#Jr1-10: See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant." 
#Jr1-11: The word of the LORD came to me: "What do you see, Jeremiah?" "I see the branch of an almond tree," I replied. 
#Jr1-12: The LORD said to me, "You have seen correctly, for I am watching "to see that my word is fulfilled." 
#Jr1-13: The word of the LORD came to me again: "What do you see?" "I see a pot that is boiling," I answered. "It is tilting toward us from the north." 
#Jr1-14: The LORD said to me, "From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land. 
#Jr1-15: I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms," declares the LORD. "Their kings will come and set up their thrones in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah. 
#Jr1-16: I will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made. 
#Jr1-17: "Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them. 
#Jr1-18: Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land —against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land. 
#Jr1-19: They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you," declares the LORD.
 JEREMIAS 2
#Jr2-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Jr2-2: "Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: "This is what the LORD says: "'I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the wilderness, through a land not sown. 
#Jr2-3: Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them,'" declares the LORD. 
#Jr2-4: Hear the word of the LORD, you descendants of Jacob, all you clans of Israel. 
#Jr2-5: This is what the LORD says: "What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves. 
#Jr2-6: They did not ask, 'Where is the LORD, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, a land of drought and utter darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?' 
#Jr2-7: I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce. But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable. 
#Jr2-8: The priests did not ask, 'Where is the LORD?' Those who deal with the law did not know me; the leaders rebelled against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal, following worthless idols. 
#Jr2-9: "Therefore I bring charges against you again," declares the LORD. "And I will bring charges against your children's children. 
#Jr2-10: Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar "and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this: 
#Jr2-11: Has a nation ever changed its gods? (Yet they are not gods at all.) But my people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols. 
#Jr2-12: Be appalled at this, you heavens, and shudder with great horror," declares the LORD. 
#Jr2-13: "My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water. 
#Jr2-14: Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder? 
#Jr2-15: Lions have roared; they have growled at him. They have laid waste his land; his towns are burned and deserted. 
#Jr2-16: Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skull. 
#Jr2-17: Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the LORD your God when he led you in the way? 
#Jr2-18: Now why go to Egypt to drink water from the Nile "? And why go to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates? 
#Jr2-19: Your wickedness will punish you; your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the LORD your God and have no awe of me," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. 
#Jr2-20: "Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, 'I will not serve you!' Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute. 
#Jr2-21: I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine? 
#Jr2-22: Although you wash yourself with soap and use an abundance of cleansing powder, the stain of your guilt is still before me," declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Jr2-23: "How can you say, 'I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals'? See how you behaved in the valley; consider what you have done. You are a swift she-camel running here and there, 
#Jr2-24: a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving — in her heat who can restrain her? Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves; at mating time they will find her. 
#Jr2-25: Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry. But you said, 'It's no use! I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.' 
#Jr2-26: "As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the people of Israel are disgraced — they, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets. 
#Jr2-27: They say to wood, 'You are my father,' and to stone, 'You gave me birth.' They have turned their backs to me and not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say, 'Come and save us!' 
#Jr2-28: Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns. 
#Jr2-29: "Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me," declares the LORD. 
#Jr2-30: "In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravenous lion. 
#Jr2-31: "You of this generation, consider the word of the LORD: "Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, 'We are free to roam; we will come to you no more'? 
#Jr2-32: Does a young woman forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number. 
#Jr2-33: How skilled you are at pursuing love! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways. 
#Jr2-34: On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all this 
#Jr2-35: you say, 'I am innocent; he is not angry with me.' But I will pass judgment on you because you say, 'I have not sinned.' 
#Jr2-36: Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria. 
#Jr2-37: You will also leave that place with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those you trust; you will not be helped by them.
 JEREMIAS 3
#Jr3-1: "If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man, should he return to her again? Would not the land be completely defiled? But you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers — would you now return to me?" declares the LORD. 
#Jr3-2: "Look up to the barren heights and see. Is there any place where you have not been ravished? By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers, sat like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness. 
#Jr3-3: Therefore the showers have been withheld, and no spring rains have fallen. Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute; you refuse to blush with shame. 
#Jr3-4: Have you not just called to me: 'My Father, my friend from my youth, 
#Jr3-5: will you always be angry? Will your wrath continue forever?' This is how you talk, but you do all the evil you can." 
#Jr3-6: During the reign of King Josiah, the LORD said to me, "Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there. 
#Jr3-7: I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. 
#Jr3-8: I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery. 
#Jr3-9: Because Israel's immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood. 
#Jr3-10: In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense," declares the LORD. 
#Jr3-11: The LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah. 
#Jr3-12: Go, proclaim this message toward the north: "'Return, faithless Israel,' declares the LORD, 'I will frown on you no longer, for I am faithful,' declares the LORD, 'I will not be angry forever. 
#Jr3-13: Only acknowledge your guilt — you have rebelled against the LORD your God, you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree, and have not obeyed me,'" declares the LORD. 
#Jr3-14: "Return, faithless people," declares the LORD, "for I am your husband. I will choose you —one from a town and two from a clan —and bring you to Zion. 
#Jr3-15: Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding. 
#Jr3-16: In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land," declares the LORD, "people will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the LORD.' It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made. 
#Jr3-17: At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts. 
#Jr3-18: In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance. 
#Jr3-19: "I myself said, "'How gladly would I treat you like my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation.' I thought you would call me 'Father' and not turn away from following me. 
#Jr3-20: But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me," declares the LORD. 
#Jr3-21: A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the LORD their God. 
#Jr3-22: "Return, faithless people; I will cure you of backsliding." "Yes, we will come to you, for you are the LORD our God. 
#Jr3-23: Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception; surely in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel. 
#Jr3-24: From our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our ancestors' labor — their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters. 
#Jr3-25: Let us lie down in our shame, and let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the LORD our God, both we and our ancestors; from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the LORD our God."
 JEREMIAS 4
#Jr4-1: "If you, Israel, will return, then return to me," declares the LORD. "If you put your detestable idols out of my sight and no longer go astray, 
#Jr4-2: and if in a truthful, just and righteous way you swear, 'As surely as the LORD lives,' then the nations will invoke blessings by him and in him they will boast." 
#Jr4-3: This is what the LORD says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: "Break up your unplowed ground and do not sow among thorns. 
#Jr4-4: Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, circumcise your hearts, you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or my wrath will flare up and burn like fire because of the evil you have done — burn with no one to quench it. 
#Jr4-5: "Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say: 'Sound the trumpet throughout the land!' Cry aloud and say: 'Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities!' 
#Jr4-6: Raise the signal to go to Zion! Flee for safety without delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north, even terrible destruction." 
#Jr4-7: A lion has come out of his lair; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to lay waste your land. Your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant. 
#Jr4-8: So put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from us. 
#Jr4-9: "In that day," declares the LORD, "the king and the officials will lose heart, the priests will be horrified, and the prophets will be appalled." 
#Jr4-10: Then I said, "Alas, Sovereign LORD! How completely you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, 'You will have peace,' when the sword is at our throats!" 
#Jr4-11: At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, "A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow or cleanse; 
#Jr4-12: a wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments against them." 
#Jr4-13: Look! He advances like the clouds, his chariots come like a whirlwind, his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! We are ruined! 
#Jr4-14: Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart and be saved. How long will you harbor wicked thoughts? 
#Jr4-15: A voice is announcing from Dan, proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim. 
#Jr4-16: "Tell this to the nations, proclaim concerning Jerusalem: 'A besieging army is coming from a distant land, raising a war cry against the cities of Judah. 
#Jr4-17: They surround her like men guarding a field, because she has rebelled against me,'" declares the LORD. 
#Jr4-18: "Your own conduct and actions have brought this on you. This is your punishment. How bitter it is! How it pierces to the heart!" 
#Jr4-19: Oh, my anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain. Oh, the agony of my heart! My heart pounds within me, I cannot keep silent. For I have heard the sound of the trumpet; I have heard the battle cry. 
#Jr4-20: Disaster follows disaster; the whole land lies in ruins. In an instant my tents are destroyed, my shelter in a moment. 
#Jr4-21: How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet? 
#Jr4-22: "My people are fools; they do not know me. They are senseless children; they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil; they know not how to do good." 
#Jr4-23: I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty; and at the heavens, and their light was gone. 
#Jr4-24: I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills were swaying. 
#Jr4-25: I looked, and there were no people; every bird in the sky had flown away. 
#Jr4-26: I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert; all its towns lay in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger. 
#Jr4-27: This is what the LORD says: "The whole land will be ruined, though I will not destroy it completely. 
#Jr4-28: Therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow dark, because I have spoken and will not relent, I have decided and will not turn back." 
#Jr4-29: At the sound of horsemen and archers every town takes to flight. Some go into the thickets; some climb up among the rocks. All the towns are deserted; no one lives in them. 
#Jr4-30: What are you doing, you devastated one? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold? Why highlight your eyes with makeup? You adorn yourself in vain. Your lovers despise you; they want to kill you. 
#Jr4-31: I hear a cry as of a woman in labor, a groan as of one bearing her first child — the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands and saying, "Alas! I am fainting; my life is given over to murderers."
 JEREMIAS 5
#Jr5-1: "Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem, look around and consider, search through her squares. If you can find but one person who deals honestly and seeks the truth, I will forgive this city. 
#Jr5-2: Although they say, 'As surely as the LORD lives,' still they are swearing falsely." 
#Jr5-3: LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You struck them, but they felt no pain; you crushed them, but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent. 
#Jr5-4: I thought, "These are only the poor; they are foolish, for they do not know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God. 
#Jr5-5: So I will go to the leaders and speak to them; surely they know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God." But with one accord they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds. 
#Jr5-6: Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them, a wolf from the desert will ravage them, a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear to pieces any who venture out, for their rebellion is great and their backslidings many. 
#Jr5-7: "Why should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes. 
#Jr5-8: They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for another man's wife. 
#Jr5-9: Should I not punish them for this?" declares the LORD. "Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this? 
#Jr5-10: "Go through her vineyards and ravage them, but do not destroy them completely. Strip off her branches, for these people do not belong to the LORD. 
#Jr5-11: The people of Israel and the people of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me," declares the LORD. 
#Jr5-12: They have lied about the LORD; they said, "He will do nothing! No harm will come to us; we will never see sword or famine. 
#Jr5-13: The prophets are but wind and the word is not in them; so let what they say be done to them." 
#Jr5-14: Therefore this is what the LORD God Almighty says: "Because the people have spoken these words, I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes. 
#Jr5-15: People of Israel," declares the LORD, "I am bringing a distant nation against you — an ancient and enduring nation, a people whose language you do not know, whose speech you do not understand. 
#Jr5-16: Their quivers are like an open grave; all of them are mighty warriors. 
#Jr5-17: They will devour your harvests and food, devour your sons and daughters; they will devour your flocks and herds, devour your vines and fig trees. With the sword they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust. 
#Jr5-18: "Yet even in those days," declares the LORD, "I will not destroy you completely. 
#Jr5-19: And when the people ask, 'Why has the LORD our God done all this to us?' you will tell them, 'As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land, so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.' 
#Jr5-20: "Announce this to the descendants of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah: 
#Jr5-21: Hear this, you foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear: 
#Jr5-22: Should you not fear me?" declares the LORD. "Should you not tremble in my presence? I made the sand a boundary for the sea, an everlasting barrier it cannot cross. The waves may roll, but they cannot prevail; they may roar, but they cannot cross it. 
#Jr5-23: But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts; they have turned aside and gone away. 
#Jr5-24: They do not say to themselves, 'Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives autumn and spring rains in season, who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.' 
#Jr5-25: Your wrongdoings have kept these away; your sins have deprived you of good. 
#Jr5-26: "Among my people are the wicked who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch people. 
#Jr5-27: Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful 
#Jr5-28: and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not seek justice. They do not promote the case of the fatherless; they do not defend the just cause of the poor. 
#Jr5-29: Should I not punish them for this?" declares the LORD. "Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this? 
#Jr5-30: "A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land: 
#Jr5-31: The prophets prophesy lies, the priests rule by their own authority, and my people love it this way. But what will you do in the end?
 JEREMIAS 6
#Jr6-1: "Flee for safety, people of Benjamin! Flee from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa! Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem! For disaster looms out of the north, even terrible destruction. 
#Jr6-2: I will destroy Daughter Zion, so beautiful and delicate. 
#Jr6-3: Shepherds with their flocks will come against her; they will pitch their tents around her, each tending his own portion." 
#Jr6-4: "Prepare for battle against her! Arise, let us attack at noon! But, alas, the daylight is fading, and the shadows of evening grow long. 
#Jr6-5: So arise, let us attack at night and destroy her fortresses!" 
#Jr6-6: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Cut down the trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem. This city must be punished; it is filled with oppression. 
#Jr6-7: As a well pours out its water, so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and destruction resound in her; her sickness and wounds are ever before me. 
#Jr6-8: Take warning, Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you and make your land desolate so no one can live in it." 
#Jr6-9: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine; pass your hand over the branches again, like one gathering grapes." 
#Jr6-10: To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen to me? Their ears are closed "so they cannot hear. The word of the LORD is offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it. 
#Jr6-11: But I am full of the wrath of the LORD, and I cannot hold it in. "Pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together; both husband and wife will be caught in it, and the old, those weighed down with years. 
#Jr6-12: Their houses will be turned over to others, together with their fields and their wives, when I stretch out my hand against those who live in the land," declares the LORD. 
#Jr6-13: "From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit. 
#Jr6-14: They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. 'Peace, peace,' they say, when there is no peace. 
#Jr6-15: Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when I punish them," says the LORD. 
#Jr6-16: This is what the LORD says: "Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, 'We will not walk in it.' 
#Jr6-17: I appointed watchmen over you and said, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But you said, 'We will not listen.' 
#Jr6-18: Therefore hear, you nations; you who are witnesses, observe what will happen to them. 
#Jr6-19: Hear, you earth: I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law. 
#Jr6-20: What do I care about incense from Sheba or sweet calamus from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please me." 
#Jr6-21: Therefore this is what the LORD says: "I will put obstacles before this people. Parents and children alike will stumble over them; neighbors and friends will perish." 
#Jr6-22: This is what the LORD says: "Look, an army is coming from the land of the north; a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth. 
#Jr6-23: They are armed with bow and spear; they are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, Daughter Zion." 
#Jr6-24: We have heard reports about them, and our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like that of a woman in labor. 
#Jr6-25: Do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads, for the enemy has a sword, and there is terror on every side. 
#Jr6-26: Put on sackcloth, my people, and roll in ashes; mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us. 
#Jr6-27: "I have made you a tester of metals and my people the ore, that you may observe and test their ways. 
#Jr6-28: They are all hardened rebels, going about to slander. They are bronze and iron; they all act corruptly. 
#Jr6-29: The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire, but the refining goes on in vain; the wicked are not purged out. 
#Jr6-30: They are called rejected silver, because the LORD has rejected them."
 JEREMIAS 7
#Jr7-1: This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 
#Jr7-2: "Stand at the gate of the LORD's house and there proclaim this message: "'Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the LORD. 
#Jr7-3: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Reform your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place. 
#Jr7-4: Do not trust in deceptive words and say, "This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD!" 
#Jr7-5: If you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly, 
#Jr7-6: if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm, 
#Jr7-7: then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors for ever and ever. 
#Jr7-8: But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless. 
#Jr7-9: "'Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, "burn incense to Baal and follow other gods you have not known, 
#Jr7-10: and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and say, "We are safe" —safe to do all these detestable things? 
#Jr7-11: Has this house, which bears my Name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the LORD. 
#Jr7-12: "'Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel. 
#Jr7-13: While you were doing all these things, declares the LORD, I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen; I called you, but you did not answer. 
#Jr7-14: Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your ancestors. 
#Jr7-15: I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your fellow Israelites, the people of Ephraim.' 
#Jr7-16: "So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you. 
#Jr7-17: Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
#Jr7-18: The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to arouse my anger. 
#Jr7-19: But am I the one they are provoking? declares the LORD. Are they not rather harming themselves, to their own shame? 
#Jr7-20: "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place —on man and beast, on the trees of the field and on the crops of your land —and it will burn and not be quenched. 
#Jr7-21: "'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves! 
#Jr7-22: For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, 
#Jr7-23: but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in obedience to all I command you, that it may go well with you. 
#Jr7-24: But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward. 
#Jr7-25: From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you my servants the prophets. 
#Jr7-26: But they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors.' 
#Jr7-27: "When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you; when you call to them, they will not answer. 
#Jr7-28: Therefore say to them, 'This is the nation that has not obeyed the LORD its God or responded to correction. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips. 
#Jr7-29: "'Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and abandoned this generation that is under his wrath. 
#Jr7-30: "'The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the LORD. They have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have defiled it. 
#Jr7-31: They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire —something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind. 
#Jr7-32: So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer call it Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room. 
#Jr7-33: Then the carcasses of this people will become food for the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away. 
#Jr7-34: I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.
 JEREMIAS 8
#Jr8-1: "'At that time, declares the LORD, the bones of the kings and officials of Judah, the bones of the priests and prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves. 
#Jr8-2: They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens, which they have loved and served and which they have followed and consulted and worshiped. They will not be gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground. 
#Jr8-3: Wherever I banish them, all the survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life, declares the LORD Almighty.' 
#Jr8-4: "Say to them, 'This is what the LORD says: "'When people fall down, do they not get up? When someone turns away, do they not return? 
#Jr8-5: Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away? They cling to deceit; they refuse to return. 
#Jr8-6: I have listened attentively, but they do not say what is right. None of them repent of their wickedness, saying, "What have I done?" Each pursues their own course like a horse charging into battle. 
#Jr8-7: Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons, and the dove, the swift and the thrush observe the time of their migration. But my people do not know the requirements of the LORD. 
#Jr8-8: "'How can you say, "We are wise, for we have the law of the LORD," when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely? 
#Jr8-9: The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped. Since they have rejected the word of the LORD, what kind of wisdom do they have? 
#Jr8-10: Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit. 
#Jr8-11: They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. "Peace, peace," they say, when there is no peace. 
#Jr8-12: Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when they are punished, says the LORD. 
#Jr8-13: "'I will take away their harvest, declares the LORD. There will be no grapes on the vine. There will be no figs on the tree, and their leaves will wither. What I have given them will be taken from them. "'" 
#Jr8-14: Why are we sitting here? Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there! For the LORD our God has doomed us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against him. 
#Jr8-15: We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror. 
#Jr8-16: The snorting of the enemy's horses is heard from Dan; at the neighing of their stallions the whole land trembles. They have come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all who live there. 
#Jr8-17: "See, I will send venomous snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you," declares the LORD. 
#Jr8-18: You who are my Comforter "in sorrow, my heart is faint within me. 
#Jr8-19: Listen to the cry of my people from a land far away: "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King no longer there?" "Why have they aroused my anger with their images, with their worthless foreign idols?" 
#Jr8-20: "The harvest is past, the summer has ended, and we are not saved." 
#Jr8-21: Since my people are crushed, I am crushed; I mourn, and horror grips me. 
#Jr8-22: Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people?
 JEREMIAS 9
#Jr9-1: Oh, that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people. 
#Jr9-2: Oh, that I had in the desert a lodging place for travelers, so that I might leave my people and go away from them; for they are all adulterers, a crowd of unfaithful people. 
#Jr9-3: "They make ready their tongue like a bow, to shoot lies; it is not by truth that they triumph "in the land. They go from one sin to another; they do not acknowledge me," declares the LORD. 
#Jr9-4: "Beware of your friends; do not trust anyone in your clan. For every one of them is a deceiver, "and every friend a slanderer. 
#Jr9-5: Friend deceives friend, and no one speaks the truth. They have taught their tongues to lie; they weary themselves with sinning. 
#Jr9-6: You "live in the midst of deception; in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me," declares the LORD. 
#Jr9-7: Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: "See, I will refine and test them, for what else can I do because of the sin of my people? 
#Jr9-8: Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully. With their mouths they all speak cordially to their neighbors, but in their hearts they set traps for them. 
#Jr9-9: Should I not punish them for this?" declares the LORD. "Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?" 
#Jr9-10: I will weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the wilderness grasslands. They are desolate and untraveled, and the lowing of cattle is not heard. The birds have all fled and the animals are gone. 
#Jr9-11: "I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals; and I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there." 
#Jr9-12: Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross? 
#Jr9-13: The LORD said, "It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law. 
#Jr9-14: Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their ancestors taught them." 
#Jr9-15: Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water. 
#Jr9-16: I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them." 
#Jr9-17: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come; send for the most skillful of them. 
#Jr9-18: Let them come quickly and wail over us till our eyes overflow with tears and water streams from our eyelids. 
#Jr9-19: The sound of wailing is heard from Zion: 'How ruined we are! How great is our shame! We must leave our land because our houses are in ruins.'" 
#Jr9-20: Now, you women, hear the word of the LORD; open your ears to the words of his mouth. Teach your daughters how to wail; teach one another a lament. 
#Jr9-21: Death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our fortresses; it has removed the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares. 
#Jr9-22: Say, "This is what the LORD declares: "'Dead bodies will lie like dung on the open field, like cut grain behind the reaper, with no one to gather them.'" 
#Jr9-23: This is what the LORD says: "Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches, 
#Jr9-24: but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight," declares the LORD. 
#Jr9-25: "The days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh — 
#Jr9-26: Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places. "For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart."
 JEREMIAS 10
#Jr10-1: Hear what the LORD says to you, people of Israel. 
#Jr10-2: This is what the LORD says: "Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, though the nations are terrified by them. 
#Jr10-3: For the practices of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel. 
#Jr10-4: They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter. 
#Jr10-5: Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, their idols cannot speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them; they can do no harm nor can they do any good." 
#Jr10-6: No one is like you, LORD; you are great, and your name is mighty in power. 
#Jr10-7: Who should not fear you, King of the nations? This is your due. Among all the wise leaders of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you. 
#Jr10-8: They are all senseless and foolish; they are taught by worthless wooden idols. 
#Jr10-9: Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple — all made by skilled workers. 
#Jr10-10: But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King. When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath. 
#Jr10-11: "Tell them this: 'These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.'" [^1] 
#Jr10-12: But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. 
#Jr10-13: When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. 
#Jr10-14: Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. The images he makes are a fraud; they have no breath in them. 
#Jr10-15: They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish. 
#Jr10-16: He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the people of his inheritance — the LORD Almighty is his name. 
#Jr10-17: Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege. 
#Jr10-18: For this is what the LORD says: "At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured." 
#Jr10-19: Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, "This is my sickness, and I must endure it." 
#Jr10-20: My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My children are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter. 
#Jr10-21: The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the LORD; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered. 
#Jr10-22: Listen! The report is coming — a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals. 
#Jr10-23: LORD, I know that people's lives are not their own; it is not for them to direct their steps. 
#Jr10-24: Discipline me, LORD, but only in due measure — not in your anger, or you will reduce me to nothing. 
#Jr10-25: Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland.
 JEREMIAS 11
#Jr11-1: This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 
#Jr11-2: "Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem. 
#Jr11-3: Tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant — 
#Jr11-4: the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.' I said, 'Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. 
#Jr11-5: Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey' —the land you possess today." I answered, "Amen, LORD." 
#Jr11-6: The LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: 'Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them. 
#Jr11-7: From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, "Obey me." 
#Jr11-8: But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.'" 
#Jr11-9: Then the LORD said to me, "There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. 
#Jr11-10: They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. 
#Jr11-11: Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. 
#Jr11-12: The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. 
#Jr11-13: You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.' 
#Jr11-14: "Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress. 
#Jr11-15: "What is my beloved doing in my temple as she, with many others, works out her evil schemes? Can consecrated meat avert your punishment? When you engage in your wickedness, then you rejoice. "" 
#Jr11-16: The LORD called you a thriving olive tree with fruit beautiful in form. But with the roar of a mighty storm he will set it on fire, and its branches will be broken. 
#Jr11-17: The LORD Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you, because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal. 
#Jr11-18: Because the LORD revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing. 
#Jr11-19: I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying, "Let us destroy the tree and its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more." 
#Jr11-20: But you, LORD Almighty, who judge righteously and test the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause. 
#Jr11-21: Therefore this is what the LORD says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you, saying, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD or you will die by our hands" — 
#Jr11-22: therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: "I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine. 
#Jr11-23: Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment."
 JEREMIAS 12
#Jr12-1: You are always righteous, LORD, when I bring a case before you. Yet I would speak with you about your justice: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the faithless live at ease? 
#Jr12-2: You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are always on their lips but far from their hearts. 
#Jr12-3: Yet you know me, LORD; you see me and test my thoughts about you. Drag them off like sheep to be butchered! Set them apart for the day of slaughter! 
#Jr12-4: How long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered? Because those who live in it are wicked, the animals and birds have perished. Moreover, the people are saying, "He will not see what happens to us." 
#Jr12-5: "If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble "in safe country, how will you manage in the thickets by "the Jordan? 
#Jr12-6: Your relatives, members of your own family — even they have betrayed you; they have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them, though they speak well of you. 
#Jr12-7: "I will forsake my house, abandon my inheritance; I will give the one I love into the hands of her enemies. 
#Jr12-8: My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. She roars at me; therefore I hate her. 
#Jr12-9: Has not my inheritance become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack? Go and gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour. 
#Jr12-10: Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field; they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland. 
#Jr12-11: It will be made a wasteland, parched and desolate before me; the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares. 
#Jr12-12: Over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm, for the sword of the LORD will devour from one end of the land to the other; no one will be safe. 
#Jr12-13: They will sow wheat but reap thorns; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing. They will bear the shame of their harvest because of the LORD's fierce anger." 
#Jr12-14: This is what the LORD says: "As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the people of Judah from among them. 
#Jr12-15: But after I uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country. 
#Jr12-16: And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, 'As surely as the LORD lives' —even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal —then they will be established among my people. 
#Jr12-17: But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it," declares the LORD.
 JEREMIAS 13
#Jr13-1: This is what the LORD said to me: "Go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water." 
#Jr13-2: So I bought a belt, as the LORD directed, and put it around my waist. 
#Jr13-3: Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time: 
#Jr13-4: "Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist, and go now to Perath "and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks." 
#Jr13-5: So I went and hid it at Perath, as the LORD told me. 
#Jr13-6: Many days later the LORD said to me, "Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there." 
#Jr13-7: So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, but now it was ruined and completely useless. 
#Jr13-8: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Jr13-9: "This is what the LORD says: 'In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 
#Jr13-10: These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt —completely useless! 
#Jr13-11: For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,' declares the LORD, 'to be my people for my renown and praise and honor. But they have not listened.' 
#Jr13-12: "Say to them: 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin should be filled with wine.' And if they say to you, 'Don't we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?' 
#Jr13-13: then tell them, 'This is what the LORD says: I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land, including the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets and all those living in Jerusalem. 
#Jr13-14: I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike, declares the LORD. I will allow no pity or mercy or compassion to keep me from destroying them.'" 
#Jr13-15: Hear and pay attention, do not be arrogant, for the LORD has spoken. 
#Jr13-16: Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings the darkness, before your feet stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light, but he will turn it to utter darkness and change it to deep gloom. 
#Jr13-17: If you do not listen, I will weep in secret because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the LORD's flock will be taken captive. 
#Jr13-18: Say to the king and to the queen mother, "Come down from your thrones, for your glorious crowns will fall from your heads." 
#Jr13-19: The cities in the Negev will be shut up, and there will be no one to open them. All Judah will be carried into exile, carried completely away. 
#Jr13-20: Look up and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you, the sheep of which you boasted? 
#Jr13-21: What will you say when the LORD sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies? Will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labor? 
#Jr13-22: And if you ask yourself, "Why has this happened to me?" — it is because of your many sins that your skirts have been torn off and your body mistreated. 
#Jr13-23: Can an Ethiopian "change his skin or a leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil. 
#Jr13-24: "I will scatter you like chaff driven by the desert wind. 
#Jr13-25: This is your lot, the portion I have decreed for you," declares the LORD, "because you have forgotten me and trusted in false gods. 
#Jr13-26: I will pull up your skirts over your face that your shame may be seen — 
#Jr13-27: your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution! I have seen your detestable acts on the hills and in the fields. Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long will you be unclean?"
 JEREMIAS 14
#Jr14-1: This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought: 
#Jr14-2: "Judah mourns, her cities languish; they wail for the land, and a cry goes up from Jerusalem. 
#Jr14-3: The nobles send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns but find no water. They return with their jars unfilled; dismayed and despairing, they cover their heads. 
#Jr14-4: The ground is cracked because there is no rain in the land; the farmers are dismayed and cover their heads. 
#Jr14-5: Even the doe in the field deserts her newborn fawn because there is no grass. 
#Jr14-6: Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights and pant like jackals; their eyes fail for lack of food." 
#Jr14-7: Although our sins testify against us, do something, LORD, for the sake of your name. For we have often rebelled; we have sinned against you. 
#Jr14-8: You who are the hope of Israel, its Savior in times of distress, why are you like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who stays only a night? 
#Jr14-9: Why are you like a man taken by surprise, like a warrior powerless to save? You are among us, LORD, and we bear your name; do not forsake us! 
#Jr14-10: This is what the LORD says about this people: "They greatly love to wander; they do not restrain their feet. So the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins." 
#Jr14-11: Then the LORD said to me, "Do not pray for the well-being of this people. 
#Jr14-12: Although they fast, I will not listen to their cry; though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with the sword, famine and plague." 
#Jr14-13: But I said, "Alas, Sovereign LORD! The prophets keep telling them, 'You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.'" 
#Jr14-14: Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries "and the delusions of their own minds. 
#Jr14-15: Therefore this is what the LORD says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name: I did not send them, yet they are saying, 'No sword or famine will touch this land.' Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine. 
#Jr14-16: And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons and their daughters. I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve. 
#Jr14-17: "Speak this word to them: "'Let my eyes overflow with tears night and day without ceasing; for the Virgin Daughter, my people, has suffered a grievous wound, a crushing blow. 
#Jr14-18: If I go into the country, I see those slain by the sword; if I go into the city, I see the ravages of famine. Both prophet and priest have gone to a land they know not.'" 
#Jr14-19: Have you rejected Judah completely? Do you despise Zion? Why have you afflicted us so that we cannot be healed? We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror. 
#Jr14-20: We acknowledge our wickedness, LORD, and the guilt of our ancestors; we have indeed sinned against you. 
#Jr14-21: For the sake of your name do not despise us; do not dishonor your glorious throne. Remember your covenant with us and do not break it. 
#Jr14-22: Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Do the skies themselves send down showers? No, it is you, LORD our God. Therefore our hope is in you, for you are the one who does all this.
 JEREMIAS 15
#Jr15-1: Then the LORD said to me: "Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me, my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence! Let them go! 
#Jr15-2: And if they ask you, 'Where shall we go?' tell them, 'This is what the LORD says: "'Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for starvation, to starvation; those for captivity, to captivity.' 
#Jr15-3: "I will send four kinds of destroyers against them," declares the LORD, "the sword to kill and the dogs to drag away and the birds and the wild animals to devour and destroy. 
#Jr15-4: I will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem. 
#Jr15-5: "Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will stop to ask how you are? 
#Jr15-6: You have rejected me," declares the LORD. "You keep on backsliding. So I will reach out and destroy you; I am tired of holding back. 
#Jr15-7: I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the city gates of the land. I will bring bereavement and destruction on my people, for they have not changed their ways. 
#Jr15-8: I will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea. At midday I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of their young men; suddenly I will bring down on them anguish and terror. 
#Jr15-9: The mother of seven will grow faint and breathe her last. Her sun will set while it is still day; she will be disgraced and humiliated. I will put the survivors to the sword before their enemies," declares the LORD. 
#Jr15-10: Alas, my mother, that you gave me birth, a man with whom the whole land strives and contends! I have neither lent nor borrowed, yet everyone curses me. 
#Jr15-11: The LORD said, "Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose; surely I will make your enemies plead with you in times of disaster and times of distress. 
#Jr15-12: "Can a man break iron — iron from the north —or bronze? 
#Jr15-13: "Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without charge, because of all your sins throughout your country. 
#Jr15-14: I will enslave you to your enemies in "a land you do not know, for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you." 
#Jr15-15: LORD, you understand; remember me and care for me. Avenge me on my persecutors. You are long-suffering —do not take me away; think of how I suffer reproach for your sake. 
#Jr15-16: When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart's delight, for I bear your name, LORD God Almighty. 
#Jr15-17: I never sat in the company of revelers, never made merry with them; I sat alone because your hand was on me and you had filled me with indignation. 
#Jr15-18: Why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable? You are to me like a deceptive brook, like a spring that fails. 
#Jr15-19: Therefore this is what the LORD says: "If you repent, I will restore you that you may serve me; if you utter worthy, not worthless, words, you will be my spokesman. Let this people turn to you, but you must not turn to them. 
#Jr15-20: I will make you a wall to this people, a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue and save you," declares the LORD. 
#Jr15-21: "I will save you from the hands of the wicked and deliver you from the grasp of the cruel."
 JEREMIAS 16
#Jr16-1: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Jr16-2: "You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place." 
#Jr16-3: For this is what the LORD says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers: 
#Jr16-4: "They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals." 
#Jr16-5: For this is what the LORD says: "Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing, my love and my pity from this people," declares the LORD. 
#Jr16-6: "Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead. 
#Jr16-7: No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead —not even for a father or a mother —nor will anyone give them a drink to console them. 
#Jr16-8: "And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink. 
#Jr16-9: For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place. 
#Jr16-10: "When you tell these people all this and they ask you, 'Why has the LORD decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the LORD our God?' 
#Jr16-11: then say to them, 'It is because your ancestors forsook me,' declares the LORD, 'and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law. 
#Jr16-12: But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. 
#Jr16-13: So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.' 
#Jr16-14: "However, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no longer be said, 'As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,' 
#Jr16-15: but it will be said, 'As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.' For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors. 
#Jr16-16: "But now I will send for many fishermen," declares the LORD, "and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks. 
#Jr16-17: My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. 
#Jr16-18: I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols." 
#Jr16-19: LORD, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in time of distress, to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say, "Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods, worthless idols that did them no good. 
#Jr16-20: Do people make their own gods? Yes, but they are not gods!" 
#Jr16-21: "Therefore I will teach them — this time I will teach them my power and might. Then they will know that my name is the LORD.
 JEREMIAS 17
#Jr17-1: "Judah's sin is engraved with an iron tool, inscribed with a flint point, on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars. 
#Jr17-2: Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles "beside the spreading trees and on the high hills. 
#Jr17-3: My mountain in the land and your "wealth and all your treasures I will give away as plunder, together with your high places, because of sin throughout your country. 
#Jr17-4: Through your own fault you will lose the inheritance I gave you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have kindled my anger, and it will burn forever." 
#Jr17-5: This is what the LORD says: "Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the LORD. 
#Jr17-6: That person will be like a bush in the wastelands; they will not see prosperity when it comes. They will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives. 
#Jr17-7: "But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. 
#Jr17-8: They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit." 
#Jr17-9: The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it? 
#Jr17-10: "I the LORD search the heart and examine the mind, to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their deeds deserve." 
#Jr17-11: Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay are those who gain riches by unjust means. When their lives are half gone, their riches will desert them, and in the end they will prove to be fools. 
#Jr17-12: A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary. 
#Jr17-13: LORD, you are the hope of Israel; all who forsake you will be put to shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the LORD, the spring of living water. 
#Jr17-14: Heal me, LORD, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved, for you are the one I praise. 
#Jr17-15: They keep saying to me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it now be fulfilled!" 
#Jr17-16: I have not run away from being your shepherd; you know I have not desired the day of despair. What passes my lips is open before you. 
#Jr17-17: Do not be a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster. 
#Jr17-18: Let my persecutors be put to shame, but keep me from shame; let them be terrified, but keep me from terror. Bring on them the day of disaster; destroy them with double destruction. 
#Jr17-19: This is what the LORD said to me: "Go and stand at the Gate of the People, "through which the kings of Judah go in and out; stand also at all the other gates of Jerusalem. 
#Jr17-20: Say to them, 'Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah and all people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem who come through these gates. 
#Jr17-21: This is what the LORD says: Be careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem. 
#Jr17-22: Do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors. 
#Jr17-23: Yet they did not listen or pay attention; they were stiff-necked and would not listen or respond to discipline. 
#Jr17-24: But if you are careful to obey me, declares the LORD, and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it, 
#Jr17-25: then kings who sit on David's throne will come through the gates of this city with their officials. They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. 
#Jr17-26: People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin and the western foothills, from the hill country and the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD. 
#Jr17-27: But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will consume her fortresses.'"
 JEREMIAS 18
#Jr18-1: This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 
#Jr18-2: "Go down to the potter's house, and there I will give you my message." 
#Jr18-3: So I went down to the potter's house, and I saw him working at the wheel. 
#Jr18-4: But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him. 
#Jr18-5: Then the word of the LORD came to me. 
#Jr18-6: He said, "Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?" declares the LORD. "Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel. 
#Jr18-7: If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, 
#Jr18-8: and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. 
#Jr18-9: And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, 
#Jr18-10: and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it. 
#Jr18-11: "Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'This is what the LORD says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.' 
#Jr18-12: But they will reply, 'It's no use. We will continue with our own plans; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.'" 
#Jr18-13: Therefore this is what the LORD says: "Inquire among the nations: Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel. 
#Jr18-14: Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever stop flowing? [^1] 
#Jr18-15: Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths. They made them walk in byways, on roads not built up. 
#Jr18-16: Their land will be an object of horror and of lasting scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads. 
#Jr18-17: Like a wind from the east, I will scatter them before their enemies; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster." 
#Jr18-18: They said, "Come, let's make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not cease, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let's attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says." 
#Jr18-19: Listen to me, LORD; hear what my accusers are saying! 
#Jr18-20: Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember that I stood before you and spoke in their behalf to turn your wrath away from them. 
#Jr18-21: So give their children over to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men slain by the sword in battle. 
#Jr18-22: Let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet. 
#Jr18-23: But you, LORD, know all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.
 JEREMIAS 19
#Jr19-1: This is what the LORD says: "Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests 
#Jr19-2: and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There proclaim the words I tell you, 
#Jr19-3: and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle. 
#Jr19-4: For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent. 
#Jr19-5: They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal —something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind. 
#Jr19-6: So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. 
#Jr19-7: "'In this place I will ruin "the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who want to kill them, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and the wild animals. 
#Jr19-8: I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds. 
#Jr19-9: I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them.' 
#Jr19-10: "Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching, 
#Jr19-11: and say to them, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter's jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room. 
#Jr19-12: This is what I will do to this place and to those who live here, declares the LORD. I will make this city like Topheth. 
#Jr19-13: The houses in Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth —all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.'" 
#Jr19-14: Jeremiah then returned from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the court of the LORD's temple and said to all the people, 
#Jr19-15: "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Listen! I am going to bring on this city and all the villages around it every disaster I pronounced against them, because they were stiff-necked and would not listen to my words.'"
 JEREMIAS 20
#Jr20-1: When the priest Pashhur son of Immer, the official in charge of the temple of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things, 
#Jr20-2: he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the LORD's temple. 
#Jr20-3: The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "The LORD's name for you is not Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side. 
#Jr20-4: For this is what the LORD says: 'I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; with your own eyes you will see them fall by the sword of their enemies. I will give all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon, who will carry them away to Babylon or put them to the sword. 
#Jr20-5: I will deliver all the wealth of this city into the hands of their enemies —all its products, all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to Babylon. 
#Jr20-6: And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into exile to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.'" 
#Jr20-7: You deceived "me, LORD, and I was deceived "; you overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me. 
#Jr20-8: Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction. So the word of the LORD has brought me insult and reproach all day long. 
#Jr20-9: But if I say, "I will not mention his word or speak anymore in his name," his word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot. 
#Jr20-10: I hear many whispering, "Terror on every side! Denounce him! Let's denounce him!" All my friends are waiting for me to slip, saying, "Perhaps he will be deceived; then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him." 
#Jr20-11: But the LORD is with me like a mighty warrior; so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced; their dishonor will never be forgotten. 
#Jr20-12: LORD Almighty, you who examine the righteous and probe the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause. 
#Jr20-13: Sing to the LORD! Give praise to the LORD! He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked. 
#Jr20-14: Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother bore me not be blessed! 
#Jr20-15: Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, who made him very glad, saying, "A child is born to you —a son!" 
#Jr20-16: May that man be like the towns the LORD overthrew without pity. May he hear wailing in the morning, a battle cry at noon. 
#Jr20-17: For he did not kill me in the womb, with my mother as my grave, her womb enlarged forever. 
#Jr20-18: Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?
 JEREMIAS 21
#Jr21-1: The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said: 
#Jr21-2: "Inquire now of the LORD for us because Nebuchadnezzar "king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the LORD will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us." 
#Jr21-3: But Jeremiah answered them, "Tell Zedekiah, 
#Jr21-4: 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians "who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city. 
#Jr21-5: I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath. 
#Jr21-6: I will strike down those who live in this city —both man and beast —and they will die of a terrible plague. 
#Jr21-7: After that, declares the LORD, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.' 
#Jr21-8: "Furthermore, tell the people, 'This is what the LORD says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. 
#Jr21-9: Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives. 
#Jr21-10: I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the LORD. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.' 
#Jr21-11: "Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, 'Hear the word of the LORD. 
#Jr21-12: This is what the LORD says to you, house of David: "'Administer justice every morning; rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed, or my wrath will break out and burn like fire because of the evil you have done — burn with no one to quench it. 
#Jr21-13: I am against you, Jerusalem, you who live above this valley on the rocky plateau, declares the LORD — you who say, "Who can come against us? Who can enter our refuge?" 
#Jr21-14: I will punish you as your deeds deserve, declares the LORD. I will kindle a fire in your forests that will consume everything around you.'"
 JEREMIAS 22
#Jr22-1: This is what the LORD says: "Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there: 
#Jr22-2: 'Hear the word of the LORD to you, king of Judah, you who sit on David's throne —you, your officials and your people who come through these gates. 
#Jr22-3: This is what the LORD says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place. 
#Jr22-4: For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David's throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people. 
#Jr22-5: But if you do not obey these commands, declares the LORD, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin.'" 
#Jr22-6: For this is what the LORD says about the palace of the king of Judah: "Though you are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon, I will surely make you like a wasteland, like towns not inhabited. 
#Jr22-7: I will send destroyers against you, each man with his weapons, and they will cut up your fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire. 
#Jr22-8: "People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this great city?' 
#Jr22-9: And the answer will be: 'Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and have worshiped and served other gods.'" 
#Jr22-10: Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled, because he will never return nor see his native land again. 
#Jr22-11: For this is what the LORD says about Shallum "son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: "He will never return. 
#Jr22-12: He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again." 
#Jr22-13: "Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his own people work for nothing, not paying them for their labor. 
#Jr22-14: He says, 'I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms.' So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar and decorates it in red. 
#Jr22-15: "Does it make you a king to have more and more cedar? Did not your father have food and drink? He did what was right and just, so all went well with him. 
#Jr22-16: He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is that not what it means to know me?" declares the LORD. 
#Jr22-17: "But your eyes and your heart are set only on dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood and on oppression and extortion." 
#Jr22-18: Therefore this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: "They will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!' They will not mourn for him: 'Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!' 
#Jr22-19: He will have the burial of a donkey — dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem." 
#Jr22-20: "Go up to Lebanon and cry out, let your voice be heard in Bashan, cry out from Abarim, for all your allies are crushed. 
#Jr22-21: I warned you when you felt secure, but you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been your way from your youth; you have not obeyed me. 
#Jr22-22: The wind will drive all your shepherds away, and your allies will go into exile. Then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness. 
#Jr22-23: You who live in 'Lebanon, "' who are nestled in cedar buildings, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain like that of a woman in labor! 
#Jr22-24: "As surely as I live," declares the LORD, "even if you, Jehoiachin "son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off. 
#Jr22-25: I will deliver you into the hands of those who want to kill you, those you fear —Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Babylonians. [^4] 
#Jr22-26: I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country, where neither of you was born, and there you both will die. 
#Jr22-27: You will never come back to the land you long to return to." 
#Jr22-28: Is this man Jehoiachin a despised, broken pot, an object no one wants? Why will he and his children be hurled out, cast into a land they do not know? 
#Jr22-29: O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD! 
#Jr22-30: This is what the LORD says: "Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah."
 JEREMIAS 23
#Jr23-1: "Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!" declares the LORD. 
#Jr23-2: Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: "Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done," declares the LORD. 
#Jr23-3: "I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. 
#Jr23-4: I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing," declares the LORD. 
#Jr23-5: "The days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will raise up for David "a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land. 
#Jr23-6: In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The LORD Our Righteous Savior. 
#Jr23-7: "So then, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when people will no longer say, 'As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,' 
#Jr23-8: but they will say, 'As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.' Then they will live in their own land." 
#Jr23-9: Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a strong man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and his holy words. 
#Jr23-10: The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse "the land lies parched and the pastures in the wilderness are withered. The prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly. 
#Jr23-11: "Both prophet and priest are godless; even in my temple I find their wickedness," declares the LORD. 
#Jr23-12: "Therefore their path will become slippery; they will be banished to darkness and there they will fall. I will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished," declares the LORD. 
#Jr23-13: "Among the prophets of Samaria I saw this repulsive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray. 
#Jr23-14: And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible: They commit adultery and live a lie. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that not one of them turns from their wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah." 
#Jr23-15: Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says concerning the prophets: "I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water, because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land." 
#Jr23-16: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD. 
#Jr23-17: They keep saying to those who despise me, 'The LORD says: You will have peace.' And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say, 'No harm will come to you.' 
#Jr23-18: But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word? 
#Jr23-19: See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked. 
#Jr23-20: The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand it clearly. 
#Jr23-21: I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied. 
#Jr23-22: But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds. 
#Jr23-23: "Am I only a God nearby," declares the LORD, "and not a God far away? 
#Jr23-24: Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them?" declares the LORD. "Do not I fill heaven and earth?" declares the LORD. 
#Jr23-25: "I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!' 
#Jr23-26: How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? 
#Jr23-27: They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. 
#Jr23-28: Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?" declares the LORD. 
#Jr23-29: "Is not my word like fire," declares the LORD, "and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces? 
#Jr23-30: "Therefore," declares the LORD, "I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. 
#Jr23-31: Yes," declares the LORD, "I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, 'The LORD declares.' 
#Jr23-32: Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams," declares the LORD. "They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least," declares the LORD. 
#Jr23-33: "When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, 'What is the message from the LORD?' say to them, 'What message? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.' 
#Jr23-34: If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, 'This is a message from the LORD,' I will punish them and their household. 
#Jr23-35: This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: 'What is the LORD's answer?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?' 
#Jr23-36: But you must not mention 'a message from the LORD' again, because each one's word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God. 
#Jr23-37: This is what you keep saying to a prophet: 'What is the LORD's answer to you?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?' 
#Jr23-38: Although you claim, 'This is a message from the LORD,' this is what the LORD says: You used the words, 'This is a message from the LORD,' even though I told you that you must not claim, 'This is a message from the LORD.' 
#Jr23-39: Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors. 
#Jr23-40: I will bring on you everlasting disgrace —everlasting shame that will not be forgotten."
 JEREMIAS 24
#Jr24-1: After Jehoiachin "son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials, the skilled workers and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the LORD. 
#Jr24-2: One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten. 
#Jr24-3: Then the LORD asked me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" "Figs," I answered. "The good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten." 
#Jr24-4: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Jr24-5: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Like these good figs, I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians. [^2] 
#Jr24-6: My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them. 
#Jr24-7: I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart. 
#Jr24-8: "'But like the bad figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten,' says the LORD, 'so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the survivors from Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt. 
#Jr24-9: I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a curse "and an object of ridicule, wherever I banish them. 
#Jr24-10: I will send the sword, famine and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.'"
 JEREMIAS 25
#Jr25-1: The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 
#Jr25-2: So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem: 
#Jr25-3: For twenty-three years —from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day —the word of the LORD has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened. 
#Jr25-4: And though the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention. 
#Jr25-5: They said, "Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the LORD gave to you and your ancestors for ever and ever. 
#Jr25-6: Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not arouse my anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you." 
#Jr25-7: "But you did not listen to me," declares the LORD, "and you have aroused my anger with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves." 
#Jr25-8: Therefore the LORD Almighty says this: "Because you have not listened to my words, 
#Jr25-9: I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon," declares the LORD, "and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy "them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting ruin. 
#Jr25-10: I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp. 
#Jr25-11: This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 
#Jr25-12: "But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, "for their guilt," declares the LORD, "and will make it desolate forever. 
#Jr25-13: I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations. 
#Jr25-14: They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands." 
#Jr25-15: This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: "Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. 
#Jr25-16: When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them." 
#Jr25-17: So I took the cup from the LORD's hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it: 
#Jr25-18: Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn, a curse "—as they are today; 
#Jr25-19: Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people, 
#Jr25-20: and all the foreign people there; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod); 
#Jr25-21: Edom, Moab and Ammon; 
#Jr25-22: all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea; 
#Jr25-23: Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in distant places "; 
#Jr25-24: all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the wilderness; 
#Jr25-25: all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media; 
#Jr25-26: and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other —all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshak "will drink it too. 
#Jr25-27: "Then tell them, 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you.' 
#Jr25-28: But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: You must drink it! 
#Jr25-29: See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword on all who live on the earth, declares the LORD Almighty.' 
#Jr25-30: "Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them: "'The LORD will roar from on high; he will thunder from his holy dwelling and roar mightily against his land. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, shout against all who live on the earth. 
#Jr25-31: The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth, for the LORD will bring charges against the nations; he will bring judgment on all mankind and put the wicked to the sword,'" declares the LORD. 
#Jr25-32: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Look! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth." 
#Jr25-33: At that time those slain by the LORD will be everywhere —from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned or gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground. 
#Jr25-34: Weep and wail, you shepherds; roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. For your time to be slaughtered has come; you will fall like the best of the rams. [^6] 
#Jr25-35: The shepherds will have nowhere to flee, the leaders of the flock no place to escape. 
#Jr25-36: Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the LORD is destroying their pasture. 
#Jr25-37: The peaceful meadows will be laid waste because of the fierce anger of the LORD. 
#Jr25-38: Like a lion he will leave his lair, and their land will become desolate because of the sword "of the oppressor and because of the LORD's fierce anger.
 JEREMIAS 26
#Jr26-1: Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the LORD: 
#Jr26-2: "This is what the LORD says: Stand in the courtyard of the LORD's house and speak to all the people of the towns of Judah who come to worship in the house of the LORD. Tell them everything I command you; do not omit a word. 
#Jr26-3: Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from their evil ways. Then I will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done. 
#Jr26-4: Say to them, 'This is what the LORD says: If you do not listen to me and follow my law, which I have set before you, 
#Jr26-5: and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again (though you have not listened), 
#Jr26-6: then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse "among all the nations of the earth.'" 
#Jr26-7: The priests, the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the LORD. 
#Jr26-8: But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the LORD had commanded him to say, the priests, the prophets and all the people seized him and said, "You must die! 
#Jr26-9: Why do you prophesy in the LORD's name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted?" And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD. 
#Jr26-10: When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from the royal palace to the house of the LORD and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD's house. 
#Jr26-11: Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, "This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!" 
#Jr26-12: Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people: "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard. 
#Jr26-13: Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the LORD your God. Then the LORD will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you. 
#Jr26-14: As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right. 
#Jr26-15: Be assured, however, that if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it, for in truth the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing." 
#Jr26-16: Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God." 
#Jr26-17: Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people, 
#Jr26-18: "Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says: "'Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.' [^2] 
#Jr26-19: "Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the LORD and seek his favor? And did not the LORD relent, so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!" 
#Jr26-20: (Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD; he prophesied the same things against this city and this land as Jeremiah did. 
#Jr26-21: When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king was determined to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt. 
#Jr26-22: King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Akbor to Egypt, along with some other men. 
#Jr26-23: They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.) 
#Jr26-24: Furthermore, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, and so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
 JEREMIAS 27
#Jr27-1: Early in the reign of Zedekiah "son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 
#Jr27-2: This is what the LORD said to me: "Make a yoke out of straps and crossbars and put it on your neck. 
#Jr27-3: Then send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
#Jr27-4: Give them a message for their masters and say, 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "Tell this to your masters: 
#Jr27-5: With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I please. 
#Jr27-6: Now I will give all your countries into the hands of my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; I will make even the wild animals subject to him. 
#Jr27-7: All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes; then many nations and great kings will subjugate him. 
#Jr27-8: "'"If, however, any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation with the sword, famine and plague, declares the LORD, until I destroy it by his hand. 
#Jr27-9: So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon.' 
#Jr27-10: They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands; I will banish you and you will perish. 
#Jr27-11: But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there, declares the LORD."'" 
#Jr27-12: I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, "Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live. 
#Jr27-13: Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the LORD has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
#Jr27-14: Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' for they are prophesying lies to you. 
#Jr27-15: 'I have not sent them,' declares the LORD. 'They are prophesying lies in my name. Therefore, I will banish you and you will perish, both you and the prophets who prophesy to you.'" 
#Jr27-16: Then I said to the priests and all these people, "This is what the LORD says: Do not listen to the prophets who say, 'Very soon now the articles from the LORD's house will be brought back from Babylon.' They are prophesying lies to you. 
#Jr27-17: Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this city become a ruin? 
#Jr27-18: If they are prophets and have the word of the LORD, let them plead with the LORD Almighty that the articles remaining in the house of the LORD and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon. 
#Jr27-19: For this is what the LORD Almighty says about the pillars, the bronze Sea, the movable stands and the other articles that are left in this city, 
#Jr27-20: which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiachin "son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem — 
#Jr27-21: yes, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about the things that are left in the house of the LORD and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem: 
#Jr27-22: 'They will be taken to Babylon and there they will remain until the day I come for them,' declares the LORD. 'Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.'"
 JEREMIAS 28
#Jr28-1: In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people: 
#Jr28-2: "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
#Jr28-3: Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the LORD's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon. 
#Jr28-4: I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin "son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,' declares the LORD, 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'" 
#Jr28-5: Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD. 
#Jr28-6: He said, "Amen! May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the LORD's house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon. 
#Jr28-7: Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: 
#Jr28-8: From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. 
#Jr28-9: But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the LORD only if his prediction comes true." 
#Jr28-10: Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it, 
#Jr28-11: and he said before all the people, "This is what the LORD says: 'In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.'" At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way. 
#Jr28-12: After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: 
#Jr28-13: "Go and tell Hananiah, 'This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron. 
#Jr28-14: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.'" 
#Jr28-15: Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, "Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies. 
#Jr28-16: Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die, because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.'" 
#Jr28-17: In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.
 JEREMIAS 29
#Jr29-1: This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
#Jr29-2: (This was after King Jehoiachin "and the queen mother, the court officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem.) 
#Jr29-3: He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said: 
#Jr29-4: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
#Jr29-5: "Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. 
#Jr29-6: Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease. 
#Jr29-7: Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper." 
#Jr29-8: Yes, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. 
#Jr29-9: They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them," declares the LORD. 
#Jr29-10: This is what the LORD says: "When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place. 
#Jr29-11: For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. 
#Jr29-12: Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 
#Jr29-13: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. 
#Jr29-14: I will be found by you," declares the LORD, "and will bring you back from captivity. "I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you," declares the LORD, "and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile." 
#Jr29-15: You may say, "The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon," 
#Jr29-16: but this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David's throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile — 
#Jr29-17: yes, this is what the LORD Almighty says: "I will send the sword, famine and plague against them and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten. 
#Jr29-18: I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse "and an object of horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them. 
#Jr29-19: For they have not listened to my words," declares the LORD, "words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles have not listened either," declares the LORD. 
#Jr29-20: Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
#Jr29-21: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: "I will deliver them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes. 
#Jr29-22: Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: 'May the LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.' 
#Jr29-23: For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and in my name they have uttered lies —which I did not authorize. I know it and am a witness to it," declares the LORD. 
#Jr29-24: Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite, 
#Jr29-25: "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the other priests. You said to Zephaniah, 
#Jr29-26: 'The LORD has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada to be in charge of the house of the LORD; you should put any maniac who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons. 
#Jr29-27: So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you? 
#Jr29-28: He has sent this message to us in Babylon: It will be a long time. Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.'" 
#Jr29-29: Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet. 
#Jr29-30: Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: 
#Jr29-31: "Send this message to all the exiles: 'This is what the LORD says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has persuaded you to trust in lies, 
#Jr29-32: this is what the LORD says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he see the good things I will do for my people, declares the LORD, because he has preached rebellion against me.'"
 JEREMIAS 30
#Jr30-1: This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 
#Jr30-2: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you. 
#Jr30-3: The days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity "and restore them to the land I gave their ancestors to possess,' says the LORD." 
#Jr30-4: These are the words the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah: 
#Jr30-5: "This is what the LORD says: "'Cries of fear are heard — terror, not peace. 
#Jr30-6: Ask and see: Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale? 
#Jr30-7: How awful that day will be! No other will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it. 
#Jr30-8: "'In that day,' declares the LORD Almighty, 'I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them. 
#Jr30-9: Instead, they will serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. 
#Jr30-10: "'So do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel,' declares the LORD. 'I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid. 
#Jr30-11: I am with you and will save you,' declares the LORD. 'Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only in due measure; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.' 
#Jr30-12: "This is what the LORD says: "'Your wound is incurable, your injury beyond healing. 
#Jr30-13: There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you. 
#Jr30-14: All your allies have forgotten you; they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel, because your guilt is so great and your sins so many. 
#Jr30-15: Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins I have done these things to you. 
#Jr30-16: "'But all who devour you will be devoured; all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered; all who make spoil of you I will despoil. 
#Jr30-17: But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds,' declares the LORD, 'because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.' 
#Jr30-18: "This is what the LORD says: "'I will restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on her ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place. 
#Jr30-19: From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers, and they will not be decreased; I will bring them honor, and they will not be disdained. 
#Jr30-20: Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them. 
#Jr30-21: Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me — for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?' declares the LORD. 
#Jr30-22: "'So you will be my people, and I will be your God.'" 
#Jr30-23: See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked. 
#Jr30-24: The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand this.
 JEREMIAS 31
#Jr31-1: "At that time," declares the LORD, "I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people." 
#Jr31-2: This is what the LORD says: "The people who survive the sword will find favor in the wilderness; I will come to give rest to Israel." 
#Jr31-3: The LORD appeared to us in the past, "saying: "I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness. 
#Jr31-4: I will build you up again, and you, Virgin Israel, will be rebuilt. Again you will take up your timbrels and go out to dance with the joyful. 
#Jr31-5: Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit. 
#Jr31-6: There will be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of Ephraim, 'Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.'" 
#Jr31-7: This is what the LORD says: "Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations. Make your praises heard, and say, 'LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.' 
#Jr31-8: See, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return. 
#Jr31-9: They will come with weeping; they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son. 
#Jr31-10: "Hear the word of the LORD, you nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: 'He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.' 
#Jr31-11: For the LORD will deliver Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they. 
#Jr31-12: They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the LORD — the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more. 
#Jr31-13: Then young women will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow. 
#Jr31-14: I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my bounty," declares the LORD. 
#Jr31-15: This is what the LORD says: "A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." 
#Jr31-16: This is what the LORD says: "Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded," declares the LORD. "They will return from the land of the enemy. 
#Jr31-17: So there is hope for your descendants," declares the LORD. "Your children will return to their own land. 
#Jr31-18: "I have surely heard Ephraim's moaning: 'You disciplined me like an unruly calf, and I have been disciplined. Restore me, and I will return, because you are the LORD my God. 
#Jr31-19: After I strayed, I repented; after I came to understand, I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.' 
#Jr31-20: Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I have great compassion for him," declares the LORD. 
#Jr31-21: "Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Take note of the highway, the road that you take. Return, Virgin Israel, return to your towns. 
#Jr31-22: How long will you wander, unfaithful Daughter Israel? The LORD will create a new thing on earth — the woman will return to "the man." 
#Jr31-23: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "When I bring them back from captivity, "the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: 'The LORD bless you, you prosperous city, you sacred mountain.' 
#Jr31-24: People will live together in Judah and all its towns —farmers and those who move about with their flocks. 
#Jr31-25: I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint." 
#Jr31-26: At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me. 
#Jr31-27: "The days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will plant the kingdoms of Israel and Judah with the offspring of people and of animals. 
#Jr31-28: Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, and to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant," declares the LORD. 
#Jr31-29: "In those days people will no longer say, 'The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.' 
#Jr31-30: Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes —their own teeth will be set on edge. 
#Jr31-31: "The days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. 
#Jr31-32: It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to "them, "" declares the LORD. 
#Jr31-33: "This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time," declares the LORD. "I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
#Jr31-34: No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the LORD,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest," declares the LORD. "For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more." 
#Jr31-35: This is what the LORD says, he who appoints the sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar — the LORD Almighty is his name: 
#Jr31-36: "Only if these decrees vanish from my sight," declares the LORD, "will Israel ever cease being a nation before me." 
#Jr31-37: This is what the LORD says: "Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done," declares the LORD. 
#Jr31-38: "The days are coming," declares the LORD, "when this city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 
#Jr31-39: The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah. 
#Jr31-40: The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the LORD. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished."
 JEREMIAS 32
#Jr32-1: This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. 
#Jr32-2: The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah. 
#Jr32-3: Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, "Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, 'This is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it. 
#Jr32-4: Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the Babylonians "but will certainly be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes. 
#Jr32-5: He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the LORD. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.'" 
#Jr32-6: Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Jr32-7: Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, 'Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.' 
#Jr32-8: "Then, just as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, 'Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.' "I knew that this was the word of the LORD; 
#Jr32-9: so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels "of silver. 
#Jr32-10: I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. 
#Jr32-11: I took the deed of purchase —the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy — 
#Jr32-12: and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard. 
#Jr32-13: "In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions: 
#Jr32-14: 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time. 
#Jr32-15: For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.' 
#Jr32-16: "After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD: 
#Jr32-17: "Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you. 
#Jr32-18: You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents' sins into the laps of their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD Almighty, 
#Jr32-19: great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open to the ways of all mankind; you reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve. 
#Jr32-20: You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours. 
#Jr32-21: You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror. 
#Jr32-22: You gave them this land you had sworn to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
#Jr32-23: They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them. 
#Jr32-24: "See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine and plague, the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as you now see. 
#Jr32-25: And though the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians, you, Sovereign LORD, say to me, 'Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed.'" 
#Jr32-26: Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: 
#Jr32-27: "I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me? 
#Jr32-28: Therefore this is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it. 
#Jr32-29: The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people aroused my anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods. 
#Jr32-30: "The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but arouse my anger with what their hands have made, declares the LORD. 
#Jr32-31: From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight. 
#Jr32-32: The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done —they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem. 
#Jr32-33: They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline. 
#Jr32-34: They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled it. 
#Jr32-35: They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded —nor did it enter my mind —that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin. 
#Jr32-36: "You are saying about this city, 'By the sword, famine and plague it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon'; but this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 
#Jr32-37: I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety. 
#Jr32-38: They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
#Jr32-39: I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always fear me and that all will then go well for them and for their children after them. 
#Jr32-40: I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me. 
#Jr32-41: I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul. 
#Jr32-42: "This is what the LORD says: As I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them. 
#Jr32-43: Once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, 'It is a desolate waste, without people or animals, for it has been given into the hands of the Babylonians.' 
#Jr32-44: Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes, "declares the LORD."
 JEREMIAS 33
#Jr33-1: While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him a second time: 
#Jr33-2: "This is what the LORD says, he who made the earth, the LORD who formed it and established it —the LORD is his name: 
#Jr33-3: 'Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.' 
#Jr33-4: For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword 
#Jr33-5: in the fight with the Babylonians ": 'They will be filled with the dead bodies of the people I will slay in my anger and wrath. I will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness. 
#Jr33-6: "'Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security. 
#Jr33-7: I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity "and will rebuild them as they were before. 
#Jr33-8: I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me. 
#Jr33-9: Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.' 
#Jr33-10: "This is what the LORD says: 'You say about this place, "It is a desolate waste, without people or animals." Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there will be heard once more 
#Jr33-11: the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD, saying, "Give thanks to the LORD Almighty, for the LORD is good; his love endures forever." For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before,' says the LORD. 
#Jr33-12: "This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'In this place, desolate and without people or animals —in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks. 
#Jr33-13: In the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them,' says the LORD. 
#Jr33-14: "'The days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah. 
#Jr33-15: "'In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David's line; he will do what is just and right in the land. 
#Jr33-16: In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it "will be called: The LORD Our Righteous Savior.' 
#Jr33-17: For this is what the LORD says: 'David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of Israel, 
#Jr33-18: nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to present sacrifices.'" 
#Jr33-19: The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: 
#Jr33-20: "This is what the LORD says: 'If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time, 
#Jr33-21: then my covenant with David my servant —and my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before me —can be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. 
#Jr33-22: I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore.'" 
#Jr33-23: The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: 
#Jr33-24: "Have you not noticed that these people are saying, 'The LORD has rejected the two kingdoms "he chose'? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation. 
#Jr33-25: This is what the LORD says: 'If I have not made my covenant with day and night and established the laws of heaven and earth, 
#Jr33-26: then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes "and have compassion on them.'"
 JEREMIAS 34
#Jr34-1: While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 
#Jr34-2: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. 
#Jr34-3: You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and given into his hands. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon. 
#Jr34-4: "'Yet hear the LORD's promise to you, Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will not die by the sword; 
#Jr34-5: you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your predecessors, the kings who ruled before you, so they will make a fire in your honor and lament, "Alas, master!" I myself make this promise, declares the LORD.'" 
#Jr34-6: Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, 
#Jr34-7: while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out —Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah. 
#Jr34-8: The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. 
#Jr34-9: Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. 
#Jr34-10: So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. 
#Jr34-11: But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again. 
#Jr34-12: Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: 
#Jr34-13: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 
#Jr34-14: 'Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.' "Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. 
#Jr34-15: Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. 
#Jr34-16: But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again. 
#Jr34-17: "Therefore this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim 'freedom' for you, declares the LORD —'freedom' to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth. 
#Jr34-18: Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces. 
#Jr34-19: The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf, 
#Jr34-20: I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals. 
#Jr34-21: "I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you. 
#Jr34-22: I am going to give the order, declares the LORD, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there."
 JEREMIAS 35
#Jr35-1: This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: 
#Jr35-2: "Go to the Rekabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the LORD and give them wine to drink." 
#Jr35-3: So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons —the whole family of the Rekabites. 
#Jr35-4: I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper. 
#Jr35-5: Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them, "Drink some wine." 
#Jr35-6: But they replied, "We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab "son of Rekab gave us this command: 'Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine. 
#Jr35-7: Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.' 
#Jr35-8: We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine 
#Jr35-9: or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops. 
#Jr35-10: We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab commanded us. 
#Jr35-11: But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, 'Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian "and Aramean armies.' So we have remained in Jerusalem." 
#Jr35-12: Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying: 
#Jr35-13: "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?' declares the LORD. 
#Jr35-14: 'Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me. 
#Jr35-15: Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, "Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors." But you have not paid attention or listened to me. 
#Jr35-16: The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.' 
#Jr35-17: "Therefore this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.'" 
#Jr35-18: Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jehonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.' 
#Jr35-19: Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'Jehonadab son of Rekab will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.'"
 JEREMIAS 36
#Jr36-1: In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 
#Jr36-2: "Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now. 
#Jr36-3: Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin." 
#Jr36-4: So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the LORD had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll. 
#Jr36-5: Then Jeremiah told Baruch, "I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the LORD's temple. 
#Jr36-6: So you go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the LORD that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns. 
#Jr36-7: Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD and will each turn from their wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great." 
#Jr36-8: Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD's temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll. 
#Jr36-9: In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah. 
#Jr36-10: From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD's temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll. 
#Jr36-11: When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll, 
#Jr36-12: he went down to the secretary's room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. 
#Jr36-13: After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, 
#Jr36-14: all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand. 
#Jr36-15: They said to him, "Sit down, please, and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them. 
#Jr36-16: When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king." 
#Jr36-17: Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?" 
#Jr36-18: "Yes," Baruch replied, "he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll." 
#Jr36-19: Then the officials said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are." 
#Jr36-20: After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. 
#Jr36-21: The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him. 
#Jr36-22: It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. 
#Jr36-23: Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe's knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire. 
#Jr36-24: The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. 
#Jr36-25: Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 
#Jr36-26: Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them. 
#Jr36-27: After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: 
#Jr36-28: "Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. 
#Jr36-29: Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, 'This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, "Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast?" 
#Jr36-30: Therefore this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night. 
#Jr36-31: I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.'" 
#Jr36-32: So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
 JEREMIAS 37
#Jr37-1: Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin "son of Jehoiakim. 
#Jr37-2: Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the LORD had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet. 
#Jr37-3: King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: "Please pray to the LORD our God for us." 
#Jr37-4: Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. 
#Jr37-5: Pharaoh's army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians "who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem. 
#Jr37-6: Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet: 
#Jr37-7: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, 'Pharaoh's army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt. 
#Jr37-8: Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.' 
#Jr37-9: "This is what the LORD says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, 'The Babylonians will surely leave us.' They will not! 
#Jr37-10: Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian "army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down." 
#Jr37-11: After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army, 
#Jr37-12: Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there. 
#Jr37-13: But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, "You are deserting to the Babylonians!" 
#Jr37-14: "That's not true!" Jeremiah said. "I am not deserting to the Babylonians." But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 
#Jr37-15: They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison. 
#Jr37-16: Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time. 
#Jr37-17: Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, "Is there any word from the LORD?" "Yes," Jeremiah replied, "you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon." 
#Jr37-18: Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison? 
#Jr37-19: Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, 'The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land'? 
#Jr37-20: But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there." 
#Jr37-21: King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
 JEREMIAS 38
#Jr38-1: Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehukal "son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said, 
#Jr38-2: "This is what the LORD says: 'Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians "will live. They will escape with their lives; they will live.' 
#Jr38-3: And this is what the LORD says: 'This city will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.'" 
#Jr38-4: Then the officials said to the king, "This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin." 
#Jr38-5: "He is in your hands," King Zedekiah answered. "The king can do nothing to oppose you." 
#Jr38-6: So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king's son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud. 
#Jr38-7: But Ebed-Melek, a Cushite, "an official "in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate, 
#Jr38-8: Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him, 
#Jr38-9: "My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city." 
#Jr38-10: Then the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite, "Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies." 
#Jr38-11: So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. 
#Jr38-12: Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, "Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes." Jeremiah did so, 
#Jr38-13: and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. 
#Jr38-14: Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the LORD. "I am going to ask you something," the king said to Jeremiah. "Do not hide anything from me." 
#Jr38-15: Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me." 
#Jr38-16: But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: "As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who want to kill you." 
#Jr38-17: Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "This is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live. 
#Jr38-18: But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from them.'" 
#Jr38-19: King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me." 
#Jr38-20: "They will not hand you over," Jeremiah replied. "Obey the LORD by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared. 
#Jr38-21: But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me: 
#Jr38-22: All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you: "'They misled you and overcame you — those trusted friends of yours. Your feet are sunk in the mud; your friends have deserted you.' 
#Jr38-23: "All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will "be burned down." 
#Jr38-24: Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die. 
#Jr38-25: If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,' 
#Jr38-26: then tell them, 'I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan's house to die there.'" 
#Jr38-27: All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king. 
#Jr38-28: And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured. This is how Jerusalem was taken:
 JEREMIAS 39
#Jr39-1: In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it. 
#Jr39-2: And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year, the city wall was broken through. 
#Jr39-3: Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon. 
#Jr39-4: When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah. [^1] 
#Jr39-5: But the Babylonian "army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. 
#Jr39-6: There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah. 
#Jr39-7: Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon. 
#Jr39-8: The Babylonians "set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
#Jr39-9: Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people. 
#Jr39-10: But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields. 
#Jr39-11: Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard: 
#Jr39-12: "Take him and look after him; don't harm him but do for him whatever he asks." 
#Jr39-13: So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon 
#Jr39-14: sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people. 
#Jr39-15: While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him: 
#Jr39-16: "Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite, 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city —words concerning disaster, not prosperity. At that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes. 
#Jr39-17: But I will rescue you on that day, declares the LORD; you will not be given into the hands of those you fear. 
#Jr39-18: I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you trust in me, declares the LORD.'"
 JEREMIAS 40
#Jr40-1: The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon. 
#Jr40-2: When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, "The LORD your God decreed this disaster for this place. 
#Jr40-3: And now the LORD has brought it about; he has done just as he said he would. All this happened because you people sinned against the LORD and did not obey him. 
#Jr40-4: But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to, then don't come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please." 
#Jr40-5: However, before Jeremiah turned to go, "Nebuzaradan added, "Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please." Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go. 
#Jr40-6: So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land. 
#Jr40-7: When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon, 
#Jr40-8: they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah —Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah "the son of the Maakathite, and their men. 
#Jr40-9: Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. "Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians, "" he said. "Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you. 
#Jr40-10: I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and olive oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over." 
#Jr40-11: When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them, 
#Jr40-12: they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit. 
#Jr40-13: Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
#Jr40-14: and said to him, "Don't you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them. 
#Jr40-15: Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, "Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?" 
#Jr40-16: But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, "Don't do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true."
 JEREMIAS 41
#Jr41-1: In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood and had been one of the king's officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there, 
#Jr41-2: Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land. 
#Jr41-3: Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian "soldiers who were there. 
#Jr41-4: The day after Gedaliah's assassination, before anyone knew about it, 
#Jr41-5: eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the LORD. 
#Jr41-6: Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, "Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam." 
#Jr41-7: When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern. 
#Jr41-8: But ten of them said to Ishmael, "Don't kill us! We have wheat and barley, olive oil and honey, hidden in a field." So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others. 
#Jr41-9: Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead. 
#Jr41-10: Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah —the king's daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites. 
#Jr41-11: When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed, 
#Jr41-12: they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon. 
#Jr41-13: When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad. 
#Jr41-14: All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. 
#Jr41-15: But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites. 
#Jr41-16: Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the people of Mizpah who had survived, whom Johanan had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam —the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had recovered from Gibeon. 
#Jr41-17: And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt 
#Jr41-18: to escape the Babylonians. "They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
 JEREMIAS 42
#Jr42-1: Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah "son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached 
#Jr42-2: Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, "Please hear our petition and pray to the LORD your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left. 
#Jr42-3: Pray that the LORD your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do." 
#Jr42-4: "I have heard you," replied Jeremiah the prophet. "I will certainly pray to the LORD your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the LORD says and will keep nothing back from you." 
#Jr42-5: Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the LORD your God sends you to tell us. 
#Jr42-6: Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the LORD our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the LORD our God." 
#Jr42-7: Ten days later the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. 
#Jr42-8: So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest. 
#Jr42-9: He said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says: 
#Jr42-10: 'If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you. 
#Jr42-11: Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the LORD, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands. 
#Jr42-12: I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.' 
#Jr42-13: "However, if you say, 'We will not stay in this land,' and so disobey the LORD your God, 
#Jr42-14: and if you say, 'No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,' 
#Jr42-15: then hear the word of the LORD, you remnant of Judah. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there, 
#Jr42-16: then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. 
#Jr42-17: Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.' 
#Jr42-18: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be a curse "and an object of horror, a curse "and an object of reproach; you will never see this place again.' 
#Jr42-19: "Remnant of Judah, the LORD has told you, 'Do not go to Egypt.' Be sure of this: I warn you today 
#Jr42-20: that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the LORD your God and said, 'Pray to the LORD our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will do it.' 
#Jr42-21: I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the LORD your God in all he sent me to tell you. 
#Jr42-22: So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle."
 JEREMIAS 43
#Jr43-1: When Jeremiah had finished telling the people all the words of the LORD their God —everything the LORD had sent him to tell them — 
#Jr43-2: Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, "You are lying! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, 'You must not go to Egypt to settle there.' 
#Jr43-3: But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians, "so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon." 
#Jr43-4: So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the LORD's command to stay in the land of Judah. 
#Jr43-5: Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered. 
#Jr43-6: They also led away all those whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan —the men, the women, the children and the king's daughters. And they took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them. 
#Jr43-7: So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the LORD and went as far as Tahpanhes. 
#Jr43-8: In Tahpanhes the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: 
#Jr43-9: "While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes. 
#Jr43-10: Then say to them, 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them. 
#Jr43-11: He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword. 
#Jr43-12: He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd picks his garment clean of lice, so he will pick Egypt clean and depart. 
#Jr43-13: There in the temple of the sun "in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.'"
 JEREMIAS 44
#Jr44-1: This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt —in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis —and in Upper Egypt: 
#Jr44-2: "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins 
#Jr44-3: because of the evil they have done. They aroused my anger by burning incense to and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew. 
#Jr44-4: Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, 'Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!' 
#Jr44-5: But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. 
#Jr44-6: Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today. 
#Jr44-7: "Now this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant? 
#Jr44-8: Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse "and an object of reproach among all the nations on earth. 
#Jr44-9: Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? 
#Jr44-10: To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors. 
#Jr44-11: "Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah. 
#Jr44-12: I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach. 
#Jr44-13: I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem. 
#Jr44-14: None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives." 
#Jr44-15: Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present —a large assembly —and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah, 
#Jr44-16: "We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD! 
#Jr44-17: We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. 
#Jr44-18: But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine." 
#Jr44-19: The women added, "When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?" 
#Jr44-20: Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him, 
#Jr44-21: "Did not the LORD remember and call to mind the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials and the people of the land? 
#Jr44-22: When the LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became a curse and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today. 
#Jr44-23: Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see." 
#Jr44-24: Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah in Egypt. 
#Jr44-25: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have done what you said you would do when you promised, 'We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.' "Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows! 
#Jr44-26: But hear the word of the LORD, all you Jews living in Egypt: 'I swear by my great name,' says the LORD, 'that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, "As surely as the Sovereign LORD lives." 
#Jr44-27: For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed. 
#Jr44-28: Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand —mine or theirs. 
#Jr44-29: "'This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,' declares the LORD, 'so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.' 
#Jr44-30: This is what the LORD says: 'I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who wanted to kill him.'"
 JEREMIAS 45
#Jr45-1: When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah said this to Baruch: 
#Jr45-2: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: 
#Jr45-3: You said, 'Woe to me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.' 
#Jr45-4: But the LORD has told me to say to you, 'This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the earth. 
#Jr45-5: Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.'"
 JEREMIAS 46
#Jr46-1: This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations: 
#Jr46-2: Concerning Egypt: This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: 
#Jr46-3: "Prepare your shields, both large and small, and march out for battle! 
#Jr46-4: Harness the horses, mount the steeds! Take your positions with helmets on! Polish your spears, put on your armor! 
#Jr46-5: What do I see? They are terrified, they are retreating, their warriors are defeated. They flee in haste without looking back, and there is terror on every side," declares the LORD. 
#Jr46-6: "The swift cannot flee nor the strong escape. In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble and fall. 
#Jr46-7: "Who is this that rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters? 
#Jr46-8: Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters. She says, 'I will rise and cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their people.' 
#Jr46-9: Charge, you horses! Drive furiously, you charioteers! March on, you warriors —men of Cush "and Put who carry shields, men of Lydia who draw the bow. 
#Jr46-10: But that day belongs to the Lord, the LORD Almighty — a day of vengeance, for vengeance on his foes. The sword will devour till it is satisfied, till it has quenched its thirst with blood. For the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will offer sacrifice in the land of the north by the River Euphrates. 
#Jr46-11: "Go up to Gilead and get balm, Virgin Daughter Egypt. But you try many medicines in vain; there is no healing for you. 
#Jr46-12: The nations will hear of your shame; your cries will fill the earth. One warrior will stumble over another; both will fall down together." 
#Jr46-13: This is the message the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to attack Egypt: 
#Jr46-14: "Announce this in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol; proclaim it also in Memphis and Tahpanhes: 'Take your positions and get ready, for the sword devours those around you.' 
#Jr46-15: Why will your warriors be laid low? They cannot stand, for the LORD will push them down. 
#Jr46-16: They will stumble repeatedly; they will fall over each other. They will say, 'Get up, let us go back to our own people and our native lands, away from the sword of the oppressor.' 
#Jr46-17: There they will exclaim, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is only a loud noise; he has missed his opportunity.' 
#Jr46-18: "As surely as I live," declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty, "one will come who is like Tabor among the mountains, like Carmel by the sea. 
#Jr46-19: Pack your belongings for exile, you who live in Egypt, for Memphis will be laid waste and lie in ruins without inhabitant. 
#Jr46-20: "Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly is coming against her from the north. 
#Jr46-21: The mercenaries in her ranks are like fattened calves. They too will turn and flee together, they will not stand their ground, for the day of disaster is coming upon them, the time for them to be punished. 
#Jr46-22: Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent as the enemy advances in force; they will come against her with axes, like men who cut down trees. 
#Jr46-23: They will chop down her forest," declares the LORD, "dense though it be. They are more numerous than locusts, they cannot be counted. 
#Jr46-24: Daughter Egypt will be put to shame, given into the hands of the people of the north." 
#Jr46-25: The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "I am about to bring punishment on Amon god of Thebes, on Pharaoh, on Egypt and her gods and her kings, and on those who rely on Pharaoh. 
#Jr46-26: I will give them into the hands of those who want to kill them —Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Later, however, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past," declares the LORD. 
#Jr46-27: "Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel. I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid. 
#Jr46-28: Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant, for I am with you," declares the LORD. "Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only in due measure; I will not let you go entirely unpunished."
 JEREMIAS 47
#Jr47-1: This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza: 
#Jr47-2: This is what the LORD says: "See how the waters are rising in the north; they will become an overflowing torrent. They will overflow the land and everything in it, the towns and those who live in them. The people will cry out; all who dwell in the land will wail 
#Jr47-3: at the sound of the hooves of galloping steeds, at the noise of enemy chariots and the rumble of their wheels. Parents will not turn to help their children; their hands will hang limp. 
#Jr47-4: For the day has come to destroy all the Philistines and to remove all survivors who could help Tyre and Sidon. The LORD is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor. [^1] 
#Jr47-5: Gaza will shave her head in mourning; Ashkelon will be silenced. You remnant on the plain, how long will you cut yourselves? 
#Jr47-6: "'Alas, sword of the LORD, how long till you rest? Return to your sheath; cease and be still.' 
#Jr47-7: But how can it rest when the LORD has commanded it, when he has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the coast?"
 JEREMIAS 48
#Jr48-1: Concerning Moab: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined. Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured; the stronghold "will be disgraced and shattered. 
#Jr48-2: Moab will be praised no more; in Heshbon "people will plot her downfall: 'Come, let us put an end to that nation.' You, the people of Madmen, "will also be silenced; the sword will pursue you. 
#Jr48-3: Cries of anguish arise from Horonaim, cries of great havoc and destruction. 
#Jr48-4: Moab will be broken; her little ones will cry out. [^4] 
#Jr48-5: They go up the hill to Luhith, weeping bitterly as they go; on the road down to Horonaim anguished cries over the destruction are heard. 
#Jr48-6: Flee! Run for your lives; become like a bush "in the desert. 
#Jr48-7: Since you trust in your deeds and riches, you too will be taken captive, and Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and officials. 
#Jr48-8: The destroyer will come against every town, and not a town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed, because the LORD has spoken. 
#Jr48-9: Put salt on Moab, for she will be laid waste "; her towns will become desolate, with no one to live in them. 
#Jr48-10: "A curse on anyone who is lax in doing the LORD's work! A curse on anyone who keeps their sword from bloodshed! 
#Jr48-11: "Moab has been at rest from youth, like wine left on its dregs, not poured from one jar to another — she has not gone into exile. So she tastes as she did, and her aroma is unchanged. 
#Jr48-12: But days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will send men who pour from pitchers, and they will pour her out; they will empty her pitchers and smash her jars. 
#Jr48-13: Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel. 
#Jr48-14: "How can you say, 'We are warriors, men valiant in battle'? 
#Jr48-15: Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded; her finest young men will go down in the slaughter," declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty. 
#Jr48-16: "The fall of Moab is at hand; her calamity will come quickly. 
#Jr48-17: Mourn for her, all who live around her, all who know her fame; say, 'How broken is the mighty scepter, how broken the glorious staff!' 
#Jr48-18: "Come down from your glory and sit on the parched ground, you inhabitants of Daughter Dibon, for the one who destroys Moab will come up against you and ruin your fortified cities. 
#Jr48-19: Stand by the road and watch, you who live in Aroer. Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, ask them, 'What has happened?' 
#Jr48-20: Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed. 
#Jr48-21: Judgment has come to the plateau — to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath, 
#Jr48-22: to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim, 
#Jr48-23: to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon, 
#Jr48-24: to Kerioth and Bozrah — to all the towns of Moab, far and near. 
#Jr48-25: Moab's horn "is cut off; her arm is broken," declares the LORD. 
#Jr48-26: "Make her drunk, for she has defied the LORD. Let Moab wallow in her vomit; let her be an object of ridicule. 
#Jr48-27: Was not Israel the object of your ridicule? Was she caught among thieves, that you shake your head in scorn whenever you speak of her? 
#Jr48-28: Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks, you who live in Moab. Be like a dove that makes its nest at the mouth of a cave. 
#Jr48-29: "We have heard of Moab's pride — how great is her arrogance! — of her insolence, her pride, her conceit and the haughtiness of her heart. 
#Jr48-30: I know her insolence but it is futile," declares the LORD, "and her boasts accomplish nothing. 
#Jr48-31: Therefore I wail over Moab, for all Moab I cry out, I moan for the people of Kir Hareseth. 
#Jr48-32: I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, you vines of Sibmah. Your branches spread as far as the sea "; they reached as far as "Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your ripened fruit and grapes. 
#Jr48-33: Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards and fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. Although there are shouts, they are not shouts of joy. 
#Jr48-34: "The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up. 
#Jr48-35: In Moab I will put an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods," declares the LORD. 
#Jr48-36: "So my heart laments for Moab like the music of a pipe; it laments like a pipe for the people of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired is gone. 
#Jr48-37: Every head is shaved and every beard cut off; every hand is slashed and every waist is covered with sackcloth. 
#Jr48-38: On all the roofs in Moab and in the public squares there is nothing but mourning, for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants," declares the LORD. 
#Jr48-39: "How shattered she is! How they wail! How Moab turns her back in shame! Moab has become an object of ridicule, an object of horror to all those around her." 
#Jr48-40: This is what the LORD says: "Look! An eagle is swooping down, spreading its wings over Moab. 
#Jr48-41: Kerioth "will be captured and the strongholds taken. In that day the hearts of Moab's warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor. 
#Jr48-42: Moab will be destroyed as a nation because she defied the LORD. 
#Jr48-43: Terror and pit and snare await you, you people of Moab," declares the LORD. 
#Jr48-44: "Whoever flees from the terror will fall into a pit, whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare; for I will bring on Moab the year of her punishment," declares the LORD. 
#Jr48-45: "In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from the midst of Sihon; it burns the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the noisy boasters. 
#Jr48-46: Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are taken into exile and your daughters into captivity. 
#Jr48-47: "Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in days to come," declares the LORD. Here ends the judgment on Moab.
 JEREMIAS 49
#Jr49-1: Concerning the Ammonites: This is what the LORD says: "Has Israel no sons? Has Israel no heir? Why then has Molek "taken possession of Gad? Why do his people live in its towns? 
#Jr49-2: But the days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites; it will become a mound of ruins, and its surrounding villages will be set on fire. Then Israel will drive out those who drove her out," says the LORD. 
#Jr49-3: "Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed! Cry out, you inhabitants of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; rush here and there inside the walls, for Molek will go into exile, together with his priests and officials. 
#Jr49-4: Why do you boast of your valleys, boast of your valleys so fruitful? Unfaithful Daughter Ammon, you trust in your riches and say, 'Who will attack me?' 
#Jr49-5: I will bring terror on you from all those around you," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. "Every one of you will be driven away, and no one will gather the fugitives. 
#Jr49-6: "Yet afterward, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites," declares the LORD. 
#Jr49-7: Concerning Edom: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed? 
#Jr49-8: Turn and flee, hide in deep caves, you who live in Dedan, for I will bring disaster on Esau at the time when I punish him. 
#Jr49-9: If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave a few grapes? If thieves came during the night, would they not steal only as much as they wanted? 
#Jr49-10: But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his hiding places, so that he cannot conceal himself. His armed men are destroyed, also his allies and neighbors, so there is no one to say, 
#Jr49-11: 'Leave your fatherless children; I will keep them alive. Your widows too can depend on me.'" 
#Jr49-12: This is what the LORD says: "If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, why should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but must drink it. 
#Jr49-13: I swear by myself," declares the LORD, "that Bozrah will become a ruin and a curse, "an object of horror and reproach; and all its towns will be in ruins forever." 
#Jr49-14: I have heard a message from the LORD; an envoy was sent to the nations to say, "Assemble yourselves to attack it! Rise up for battle!" 
#Jr49-15: "Now I will make you small among the nations, despised by mankind. 
#Jr49-16: The terror you inspire and the pride of your heart have deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks, who occupy the heights of the hill. Though you build your nest as high as the eagle's, from there I will bring you down," declares the LORD. 
#Jr49-17: "Edom will become an object of horror; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds. 
#Jr49-18: As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown, along with their neighboring towns," says the LORD, "so no one will live there; no people will dwell in it. 
#Jr49-19: "Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Edom from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?" 
#Jr49-20: Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Edom, what he has purposed against those who live in Teman: The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate. 
#Jr49-21: At the sound of their fall the earth will tremble; their cry will resound to the Red Sea. [^3]

#Jr50-1: This is the word the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians ": 
#Jr50-2: "Announce and proclaim among the nations, lift up a banner and proclaim it; keep nothing back, but say, 'Babylon will be captured; Bel will be put to shame, Marduk filled with terror. Her images will be put to shame and her idols filled with terror.' 
#Jr50-3: A nation from the north will attack her and lay waste her land. No one will live in it; both people and animals will flee away. 
#Jr50-4: "In those days, at that time," declares the LORD, "the people of Israel and the people of Judah together will go in tears to seek the LORD their God. 
#Jr50-5: They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward it. They will come and bind themselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten. 
#Jr50-6: "My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray and caused them to roam on the mountains. They wandered over mountain and hill and forgot their own resting place. 
#Jr50-7: Whoever found them devoured them; their enemies said, 'We are not guilty, for they sinned against the LORD, their verdant pasture, the LORD, the hope of their ancestors.' 
#Jr50-8: "Flee out of Babylon; leave the land of the Babylonians, and be like the goats that lead the flock. 
#Jr50-9: For I will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the land of the north. They will take up their positions against her, and from the north she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return empty-handed. 
#Jr50-10: So Babylonia "will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill," declares the LORD. 
#Jr50-11: "Because you rejoice and are glad, you who pillage my inheritance, because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain and neigh like stallions, 
#Jr50-12: your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who gave you birth will be disgraced. She will be the least of the nations — a wilderness, a dry land, a desert. 
#Jr50-13: Because of the LORD's anger she will not be inhabited but will be completely desolate. All who pass Babylon will be appalled; they will scoff because of all her wounds. 
#Jr50-14: "Take up your positions around Babylon, all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD. 
#Jr50-15: Shout against her on every side! She surrenders, her towers fall, her walls are torn down. Since this is the vengeance of the LORD, take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done to others. 
#Jr50-16: Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the reaper with his sickle at harvest. Because of the sword of the oppressor let everyone return to their own people, let everyone flee to their own land. 
#Jr50-17: "Israel is a scattered flock that lions have chased away. The first to devour them was the king of Assyria; the last to crush their bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon." 
#Jr50-18: Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria. 
#Jr50-19: But I will bring Israel back to their own pasture, and they will graze on Carmel and Bashan; their appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. 
#Jr50-20: In those days, at that time," declares the LORD, "search will be made for Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare. 
#Jr50-21: "Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue, kill and completely destroy "them," declares the LORD. "Do everything I have commanded you. 
#Jr50-22: The noise of battle is in the land, the noise of great destruction! 
#Jr50-23: How broken and shattered is the hammer of the whole earth! How desolate is Babylon among the nations! 
#Jr50-24: I set a trap for you, Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were found and captured because you opposed the LORD. 
#Jr50-25: The LORD has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians. 
#Jr50-26: Come against her from afar. Break open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain. Completely destroy her and leave her no remnant. 
#Jr50-27: Kill all her young bulls; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For their day has come, the time for them to be punished. 
#Jr50-28: Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon declaring in Zion how the LORD our God has taken vengeance, vengeance for his temple. 
#Jr50-29: "Summon archers against Babylon, all those who draw the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel. 
#Jr50-30: Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day," declares the LORD. 
#Jr50-31: "See, I am against you, you arrogant one," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty, "for your day has come, the time for you to be punished. 
#Jr50-32: The arrogant one will stumble and fall and no one will help her up; I will kindle a fire in her towns that will consume all who are around her." 
#Jr50-33: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go. 
#Jr50-34: Yet their Redeemer is strong; the LORD Almighty is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land, but unrest to those who live in Babylon. 
#Jr50-35: "A sword against the Babylonians!" declares the LORD — "against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men! 
#Jr50-36: A sword against her false prophets! They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror. 
#Jr50-37: A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become weaklings. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered. 
#Jr50-38: A drought on "her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will go mad with terror. 
#Jr50-39: "So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation. 
#Jr50-40: As I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns," declares the LORD, "so no one will live there; no people will dwell in it. 
#Jr50-41: "Look! An army is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth. 
#Jr50-42: They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and without mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, Daughter Babylon. 
#Jr50-43: The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labor. 
#Jr50-44: Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?" 
#Jr50-45: Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon, what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians: The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate. 
#Jr50-46: At the sound of Babylon's capture the earth will tremble; its cry will resound among the nations.

#Jr51-2: I will send foreigners to Babylon to winnow her and to devastate her land; they will oppose her on every side in the day of her disaster. 
#Jr51-3: Let not the archer string his bow, nor let him put on his armor. Do not spare her young men; completely destroy "her army. 
#Jr51-4: They will fall down slain in Babylon, "fatally wounded in her streets. 
#Jr51-5: For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the LORD Almighty, though their land "is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel. 
#Jr51-6: "Flee from Babylon! Run for your lives! Do not be destroyed because of her sins. It is time for the LORD's vengeance; he will repay her what she deserves. 
#Jr51-7: Babylon was a gold cup in the LORD's hand; she made the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore they have now gone mad. 
#Jr51-8: Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. Wail over her! Get balm for her pain; perhaps she can be healed. 
#Jr51-9: "'We would have healed Babylon, but she cannot be healed; let us leave her and each go to our own land, for her judgment reaches to the skies, it rises as high as the heavens.' 
#Jr51-10: "'The LORD has vindicated us; come, let us tell in Zion what the LORD our God has done.' 
#Jr51-11: "Sharpen the arrows, take up the shields! The LORD has stirred up the kings of the Medes, because his purpose is to destroy Babylon. The LORD will take vengeance, vengeance for his temple. 
#Jr51-12: Lift up a banner against the walls of Babylon! Reinforce the guard, station the watchmen, prepare an ambush! The LORD will carry out his purpose, his decree against the people of Babylon. 
#Jr51-13: You who live by many waters and are rich in treasures, your end has come, the time for you to be destroyed. 
#Jr51-14: The LORD Almighty has sworn by himself: I will surely fill you with troops, as with a swarm of locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you. 
#Jr51-15: "He made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. 
#Jr51-16: When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. 
#Jr51-17: "Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. The images he makes are a fraud; they have no breath in them. 
#Jr51-18: They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish. 
#Jr51-19: He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including the people of his inheritance — the LORD Almighty is his name. 
#Jr51-20: "You are my war club, my weapon for battle — with you I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms, 
#Jr51-21: with you I shatter horse and rider, with you I shatter chariot and driver, 
#Jr51-22: with you I shatter man and woman, with you I shatter old man and youth, with you I shatter young man and young woman, 
#Jr51-23: with you I shatter shepherd and flock, with you I shatter farmer and oxen, with you I shatter governors and officials. 
#Jr51-24: "Before your eyes I will repay Babylon and all who live in Babylonia "for all the wrong they have done in Zion," declares the LORD. 
#Jr51-25: "I am against you, you destroying mountain, you who destroy the whole earth," declares the LORD. "I will stretch out my hand against you, roll you off the cliffs, and make you a burned-out mountain. 
#Jr51-26: No rock will be taken from you for a cornerstone, nor any stone for a foundation, for you will be desolate forever," declares the LORD. 
#Jr51-27: "Lift up a banner in the land! Blow the trumpet among the nations! Prepare the nations for battle against her; summon against her these kingdoms: Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander against her; send up horses like a swarm of locusts. 
#Jr51-28: Prepare the nations for battle against her — the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their officials, and all the countries they rule. 
#Jr51-29: The land trembles and writhes, for the LORD's purposes against Babylon stand — to lay waste the land of Babylon so that no one will live there. 
#Jr51-30: Babylon's warriors have stopped fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength is exhausted; they have become weaklings. Her dwellings are set on fire; the bars of her gates are broken. 
#Jr51-31: One courier follows another and messenger follows messenger to announce to the king of Babylon that his entire city is captured, 
#Jr51-32: the river crossings seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers terrified." 
#Jr51-33: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; the time to harvest her will soon come." 
#Jr51-34: "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured us, he has thrown us into confusion, he has made us an empty jar. Like a serpent he has swallowed us and filled his stomach with our delicacies, and then has spewed us out. 
#Jr51-35: May the violence done to our flesh "be on Babylon," say the inhabitants of Zion. "May our blood be on those who live in Babylonia," says Jerusalem. 
#Jr51-36: Therefore this is what the LORD says: "See, I will defend your cause and avenge you; I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry. 
#Jr51-37: Babylon will be a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, an object of horror and scorn, a place where no one lives. 
#Jr51-38: Her people all roar like young lions, they growl like lion cubs. 
#Jr51-39: But while they are aroused, I will set out a feast for them and make them drunk, so that they shout with laughter — then sleep forever and not awake," declares the LORD. 
#Jr51-40: "I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats. 
#Jr51-41: "How Sheshak "will be captured, the boast of the whole earth seized! How desolate Babylon will be among the nations! 
#Jr51-42: The sea will rise over Babylon; its roaring waves will cover her. 
#Jr51-43: Her towns will be desolate, a dry and desert land, a land where no one lives, through which no one travels. 
#Jr51-44: I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him. And the wall of Babylon will fall. 
#Jr51-45: "Come out of her, my people! Run for your lives! Run from the fierce anger of the LORD. 
#Jr51-46: Do not lose heart or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land; one rumor comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler. 
#Jr51-47: For the time will surely come when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced and her slain will all lie fallen within her. 
#Jr51-48: Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for out of the north destroyers will attack her," declares the LORD. 
#Jr51-49: "Babylon must fall because of Israel's slain, just as the slain in all the earth have fallen because of Babylon. 
#Jr51-50: You who have escaped the sword, leave and do not linger! Remember the LORD in a distant land, and call to mind Jerusalem." 
#Jr51-51: "We are disgraced, for we have been insulted and shame covers our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD's house." 
#Jr51-52: "But days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan. 
#Jr51-53: Even if Babylon ascends to the heavens and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her," declares the LORD. 
#Jr51-54: "The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians. [^8] 
#Jr51-55: The LORD will destroy Babylon; he will silence her noisy din. Waves of enemies will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound. 
#Jr51-56: A destroyer will come against Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the LORD is a God of retribution; he will repay in full. 
#Jr51-57: I will make her officials and wise men drunk, her governors, officers and warriors as well; they will sleep forever and not awake," declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty. 
#Jr51-58: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Babylon's thick wall will be leveled and her high gates set on fire; the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, the nations' labor is only fuel for the flames." 
#Jr51-59: This is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. 
#Jr51-60: Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon —all that had been recorded concerning Babylon. 
#Jr51-61: He said to Seraiah, "When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. 
#Jr51-62: Then say, 'LORD, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither people nor animals will live in it; it will be desolate forever.' 
#Jr51-63: When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates. 
#Jr51-64: Then say, 'So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring on her. And her people will fall.'" The words of Jeremiah end here.
 JEREMIAS 52
#Jr52-1: Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. 
#Jr52-2: He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done. 
#Jr52-3: It was because of the LORD's anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
#Jr52-4: So in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. 
#Jr52-5: The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 
#Jr52-6: By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat. 
#Jr52-7: Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, though the Babylonians "were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah, [^2] 
#Jr52-8: but the Babylonian "army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered, 
#Jr52-9: and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. 
#Jr52-10: There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah. 
#Jr52-11: Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death. 
#Jr52-12: On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.

#Jr52-14: The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. 
#Jr52-15: Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the rest of the craftsmen "and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon. 
#Jr52-16: But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields. 
#Jr52-17: The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried all the bronze to Babylon. 
#Jr52-18: They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service. 
#Jr52-19: The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings —all that were made of pure gold or silver. 
#Jr52-20: The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed. 
#Jr52-21: Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference "; each was four fingers thick, and hollow. 
#Jr52-22: The bronze capital on top of one pillar was five cubits "high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar. 
#Jr52-23: There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred. 
#Jr52-24: The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers. 
#Jr52-25: Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land, sixty of whom were found in the city. 
#Jr52-26: Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
#Jr52-27: There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land. 
#Jr52-28: This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews; 
#Jr52-29: in Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem; 
#Jr52-30: in his twenty-third year, 745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard. There were 4,600 people in all. 
#Jr52-31: In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison. 
#Jr52-32: He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
#Jr52-33: So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king's table. 
#Jr52-34: Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death.

#Lm2-3: In fierce anger he has cut off every horn ""of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it. 
#Lm2-4: Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of Daughter Zion. 
#Lm2-5: The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for Daughter Judah. 
#Lm2-6: He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed festivals and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest. 
#Lm2-7: The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has given the walls of her palaces into the hands of the enemy; they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed festival. 
#Lm2-8: The LORD determined to tear down the wall around Daughter Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.

#Lm2-10: The elders of Daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground. 
#Lm2-11: My eyes fail from weeping, I am in torment within; my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city. 
#Lm2-12: They say to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers' arms. 
#Lm2-13: What can I say for you? With what can I compare you, Daughter Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, Virgin Daughter Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you? 
#Lm2-14: The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The prophecies they gave you were false and misleading. 
#Lm2-15: All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at Daughter Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"

#Lm2-20: "Look, LORD, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord? 
#Lm2-21: "Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and young women have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity. 
#Lm2-22: "As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the LORD's anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared my enemy has destroyed."

 EZEQUIEL 1
#Ez1-1: In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. 
#Ez1-2: On the fifth of the month —it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin — 
#Ez1-3: the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. "There the hand of the LORD was on him. 
#Ez1-4: I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north —an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, 
#Ez1-5: and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, 
#Ez1-6: but each of them had four faces and four wings. 
#Ez1-7: Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. 
#Ez1-8: Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, 
#Ez1-9: and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved. 
#Ez1-10: Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. 
#Ez1-11: Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. 
#Ez1-12: Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. 
#Ez1-13: The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. 
#Ez1-14: The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning. 
#Ez1-15: As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. 
#Ez1-16: This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. 
#Ez1-17: As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. 
#Ez1-18: Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. 
#Ez1-19: When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. 
#Ez1-20: Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
#Ez1-21: When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
#Ez1-22: Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. 
#Ez1-23: Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. 
#Ez1-24: When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, "like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. 
#Ez1-25: Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. 
#Ez1-26: Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. 
#Ez1-27: I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. 
#Ez1-28: Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
 EZEQUIEL 2
#Ez2-1: He said to me, "Son of man, "stand up on your feet and I will speak to you." 
#Ez2-2: As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me. 
#Ez2-3: He said: "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day. 
#Ez2-4: The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' 
#Ez2-5: And whether they listen or fail to listen —for they are a rebellious people —they will know that a prophet has been among them. 
#Ez2-6: And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people. 
#Ez2-7: You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. 
#Ez2-8: But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you." 
#Ez2-9: Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, 
#Ez2-10: which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.
 EZEQUIEL 3
#Ez3-1: And he said to me, "Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel." 
#Ez3-2: So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. 
#Ez3-3: Then he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it." So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth. 
#Ez3-4: He then said to me: "Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them. 
#Ez3-5: You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel — 
#Ez3-6: not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. 
#Ez3-7: But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate. 
#Ez3-8: But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. 
#Ez3-9: I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people." 
#Ez3-10: And he said to me, "Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. 
#Ez3-11: Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says,' whether they listen or fail to listen." 
#Ez3-12: Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of the LORD rose from the place where it was standing. [^1] 
#Ez3-13: It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. 
#Ez3-14: The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD on me. 
#Ez3-15: I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days —deeply distressed. 
#Ez3-16: At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez3-17: "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. 
#Ez3-18: When I say to a wicked person, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for "their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. 
#Ez3-19: But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself. 
#Ez3-20: "Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. 
#Ez3-21: But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself." 
#Ez3-22: The hand of the LORD was on me there, and he said to me, "Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you." 
#Ez3-23: So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown. 
#Ez3-24: Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your house. 
#Ez3-25: And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people. 
#Ez3-26: I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people. 
#Ez3-27: But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' Whoever will listen let them listen, and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people.

#Ez4-1: "Now, son of man, take a block of clay, put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it. 
#Ez4-2: Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it. 
#Ez4-3: Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel. 
#Ez4-4: "Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon yourself. "You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side. 
#Ez4-5: I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the people of Israel. 
#Ez4-6: "After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the people of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year. 
#Ez4-7: Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her. 
#Ez4-8: I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege. 
#Ez4-9: "Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side. 
#Ez4-10: Weigh out twenty shekels "of food to eat each day and eat it at set times. 
#Ez4-11: Also measure out a sixth of a hin "of water and drink it at set times. 
#Ez4-12: Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel." 
#Ez4-13: The LORD said, "In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them." 
#Ez4-14: Then I said, "Not so, Sovereign LORD! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth." 
#Ez4-15: "Very well," he said, "I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement." 
#Ez4-16: He then said to me: "Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair, 
#Ez4-17: for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of "their sin.
 EZEQUIEL 5
#Ez5-1: "Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber's razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair. 
#Ez5-2: When the days of your siege come to an end, burn a third of the hair inside the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword. 
#Ez5-3: But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment. 
#Ez5-4: Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to all Israel. 
#Ez5-5: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the center of the nations, with countries all around her. 
#Ez5-6: Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees. 
#Ez5-7: "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: You have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws. You have not even "conformed to the standards of the nations around you. 
#Ez5-8: "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations. 
#Ez5-9: Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again. 
#Ez5-10: Therefore in your midst parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds. 
#Ez5-11: Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices, I myself will shave you; I will not look on you with pity or spare you. 
#Ez5-12: A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword. 
#Ez5-13: "Then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be avenged. And when I have spent my wrath on them, they will know that I the LORD have spoken in my zeal. 
#Ez5-14: "I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by. 
#Ez5-15: You will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath and with stinging rebuke. I the LORD have spoken. 
#Ez5-16: When I shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine, I will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food. 
#Ez5-17: I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I the LORD have spoken."
 EZEQUIEL 6
#Ez6-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez6-2: "Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel; prophesy against them 
#Ez6-3: and say: 'You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places. 
#Ez6-4: Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will slay your people in front of your idols. 
#Ez6-5: I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars. 
#Ez6-6: Wherever you live, the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished, so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated, your idols smashed and ruined, your incense altars broken down, and what you have made wiped out. 
#Ez6-7: Your people will fall slain among you, and you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez6-8: "'But I will spare some, for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the lands and nations. 
#Ez6-9: Then in the nations where they have been carried captive, those who escape will remember me —how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices. 
#Ez6-10: And they will know that I am the LORD; I did not threaten in vain to bring this calamity on them. 
#Ez6-11: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Strike your hands together and stamp your feet and cry out "Alas!" because of all the wicked and detestable practices of the people of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine and plague. 
#Ez6-12: One who is far away will die of the plague, and one who is near will fall by the sword, and anyone who survives and is spared will die of famine. So will I pour out my wrath on them. 
#Ez6-13: And they will know that I am the LORD, when their people lie slain among their idols around their altars, on every high hill and on all the mountaintops, under every spreading tree and every leafy oak —places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols. 
#Ez6-14: And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the desert to Diblah "—wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'"
 EZEQUIEL 7
#Ez7-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez7-2: "Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says to the land of Israel: "'The end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land! 
#Ez7-3: The end is now upon you, and I will unleash my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices. 
#Ez7-4: I will not look on you with pity; I will not spare you. I will surely repay you for your conduct and for the detestable practices among you. "'Then you will know that I am the LORD.' 
#Ez7-5: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'Disaster! Unheard-of "disaster! See, it comes! 
#Ez7-6: The end has come! The end has come! It has roused itself against you. See, it comes! 
#Ez7-7: Doom has come upon you, upon you who dwell in the land. The time has come! The day is near! There is panic, not joy, on the mountains. 
#Ez7-8: I am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices. 
#Ez7-9: I will not look on you with pity; I will not spare you. I will repay you for your conduct and for the detestable practices among you. "'Then you will know that it is I the LORD who strikes you. 
#Ez7-10: "'See, the day! See, it comes! Doom has burst forth, the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed! 
#Ez7-11: Violence has arisen, "a rod to punish the wicked. None of the people will be left, none of that crowd — none of their wealth, nothing of value. 
#Ez7-12: The time has come! The day has arrived! Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller grieve, for my wrath is on the whole crowd. 
#Ez7-13: The seller will not recover the property that was sold — as long as both buyer and seller live. For the vision concerning the whole crowd will not be reversed. Because of their sins, not one of them will preserve their life. 
#Ez7-14: "'They have blown the trumpet, they have made all things ready, but no one will go into battle, for my wrath is on the whole crowd. 
#Ez7-15: Outside is the sword; inside are plague and famine. Those in the country will die by the sword; those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague. 
#Ez7-16: The fugitives who escape will flee to the mountains. Like doves of the valleys, they will all moan, each for their own sins. 
#Ez7-17: Every hand will go limp; every leg will be wet with urine. 
#Ez7-18: They will put on sackcloth and be clothed with terror. Every face will be covered with shame, and every head will be shaved. 
#Ez7-19: "'They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be treated as a thing unclean. Their silver and gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath. It will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs, for it has caused them to stumble into sin. 
#Ez7-20: They took pride in their beautiful jewelry and used it to make their detestable idols. They made it into vile images; therefore I will make it a thing unclean for them. 
#Ez7-21: I will give their wealth as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth, who will defile it. 
#Ez7-22: I will turn my face away from the people, and robbers will desecrate the place I treasure. They will enter it and will defile it. 
#Ez7-23: "'Prepare chains! For the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of violence. 
#Ez7-24: I will bring the most wicked of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated. 
#Ez7-25: When terror comes, they will seek peace in vain. 
#Ez7-26: Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will go searching for a vision from the prophet, priestly instruction in the law will cease, the counsel of the elders will come to an end. 
#Ez7-27: The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct, and by their own standards I will judge them. "'Then they will know that I am the LORD.'"
 EZEQUIEL 8
#Ez8-1: In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign LORD came on me there. 
#Ez8-2: I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. "From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal. 
#Ez8-3: He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood. 
#Ez8-4: And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain. 
#Ez8-5: Then he said to me, "Son of man, look toward the north." So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy. 
#Ez8-6: And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing —the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable." 
#Ez8-7: Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall. 
#Ez8-8: He said to me, "Son of man, now dig into the wall." So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there. 
#Ez8-9: And he said to me, "Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here." 
#Ez8-10: So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel. 
#Ez8-11: In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising. 
#Ez8-12: He said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, 'The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.'" 
#Ez8-13: Again, he said, "You will see them doing things that are even more detestable." 
#Ez8-14: Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz. 
#Ez8-15: He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this." 
#Ez8-16: He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east. 
#Ez8-17: He said to me, "Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose! 
#Ez8-18: Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them."
 EZEQUIEL 9
#Ez9-1: Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, "Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand." 
#Ez9-2: And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar. 
#Ez9-3: Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the LORD called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side 
#Ez9-4: and said to him, "Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it." 
#Ez9-5: As I listened, he said to the others, "Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. 
#Ez9-6: Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple. 
#Ez9-7: Then he said to them, "Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!" So they went out and began killing throughout the city. 
#Ez9-8: While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, "Alas, Sovereign LORD! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?" 
#Ez9-9: He answered me, "The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land; the LORD does not see.' 
#Ez9-10: So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done." 
#Ez9-11: Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, "I have done as you commanded."
 EZEQUIEL 10
#Ez10-1: I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over the heads of the cherubim. 
#Ez10-2: The LORD said to the man clothed in linen, "Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city." And as I watched, he went in. 
#Ez10-3: Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. 
#Ez10-4: Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple, and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the LORD. 
#Ez10-5: The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty "when he speaks. 
#Ez10-6: When the LORD commanded the man in linen, "Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim," the man went in and stood beside a wheel. 
#Ez10-7: Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it and went out. 
#Ez10-8: (Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like human hands.) 
#Ez10-9: I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz. 
#Ez10-10: As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel. 
#Ez10-11: As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about "as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced, without turning as they went. 
#Ez10-12: Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels. 
#Ez10-13: I heard the wheels being called "the whirling wheels." 
#Ez10-14: Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face was that of a cherub, the second the face of a human being, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
#Ez10-15: Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River. 
#Ez10-16: When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side. 
#Ez10-17: When the cherubim stood still, they also stood still; and when the cherubim rose, they rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in them. 
#Ez10-18: Then the glory of the LORD departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim. 
#Ez10-19: While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD's house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. 
#Ez10-20: These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim. 
#Ez10-21: Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands. 
#Ez10-22: Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River. Each one went straight ahead.
 EZEQUIEL 11
#Ez11-1: Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. 
#Ez11-2: The LORD said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city. 
#Ez11-3: They say, 'Haven't our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot, and we are the meat in it.' 
#Ez11-4: Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man." 
#Ez11-5: Then the Spirit of the LORD came on me, and he told me to say: "This is what the LORD says: That is what you are saying, you leaders in Israel, but I know what is going through your mind. 
#Ez11-6: You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead. 
#Ez11-7: "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it. 
#Ez11-8: You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez11-9: I will drive you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and inflict punishment on you. 
#Ez11-10: You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez11-11: This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. 
#Ez11-12: And you will know that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you." 
#Ez11-13: Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, "Alas, Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?" 
#Ez11-14: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez11-15: "Son of man, the people of Jerusalem have said of your fellow exiles and all the other Israelites, 'They are far away from the LORD; this land was given to us as our possession.' 
#Ez11-16: "Therefore say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.' 
#Ez11-17: "Therefore say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.' 
#Ez11-18: "They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols. 
#Ez11-19: I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. 
#Ez11-20: Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
#Ez11-21: But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD." 
#Ez11-22: Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. 
#Ez11-23: The glory of the LORD went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it. 
#Ez11-24: The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia "in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me, 
#Ez11-25: and I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me.
 EZEQUIEL 12
#Ez12-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez12-2: "Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people. 
#Ez12-3: "Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people. 
#Ez12-4: During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile. 
#Ez12-5: While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it. 
#Ez12-6: Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the Israelites." 
#Ez12-7: So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched. 
#Ez12-8: In the morning the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez12-9: "Son of man, did not the Israelites, that rebellious people, ask you, 'What are you doing?' 
#Ez12-10: "Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This prophecy concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the Israelites who are there.' 
#Ez12-11: Say to them, 'I am a sign to you.' "As I have done, so it will be done to them. They will go into exile as captives. 
#Ez12-12: "The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land. 
#Ez12-13: I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die. 
#Ez12-14: I will scatter to the winds all those around him —his staff and all his troops —and I will pursue them with drawn sword. 
#Ez12-15: "They will know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries. 
#Ez12-16: But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine and plague, so that in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices. Then they will know that I am the LORD." 
#Ez12-17: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez12-18: "Son of man, tremble as you eat your food, and shudder in fear as you drink your water. 
#Ez12-19: Say to the people of the land: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there. 
#Ez12-20: The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'" 
#Ez12-21: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez12-22: "Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel: 'The days go by and every vision comes to nothing'? 
#Ez12-23: Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.' Say to them, 'The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled. 
#Ez12-24: For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of Israel. 
#Ez12-25: But I the LORD will speak what I will, and it shall be fulfilled without delay. For in your days, you rebellious people, I will fulfill whatever I say, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" 
#Ez12-26: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez12-27: "Son of man, the Israelites are saying, 'The vision he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies about the distant future.' 
#Ez12-28: "Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: None of my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares the Sovereign LORD.'"
 EZEQUIEL 13
#Ez13-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez13-2: "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: 'Hear the word of the LORD! 
#Ez13-3: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the foolish "prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing! 
#Ez13-4: Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins. 
#Ez13-5: You have not gone up to the breaches in the wall to repair it for the people of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the LORD. 
#Ez13-6: Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. Even though the LORD has not sent them, they say, "The LORD declares," and expect him to fulfill their words. 
#Ez13-7: Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say, "The LORD declares," though I have not spoken? 
#Ez13-8: "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because of your false words and lying visions, I am against you, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez13-9: My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez13-10: "'Because they lead my people astray, saying, "Peace," when there is no peace, and because, when a flimsy wall is built, they cover it with whitewash, 
#Ez13-11: therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain will come in torrents, and I will send hailstones hurtling down, and violent winds will burst forth. 
#Ez13-12: When the wall collapses, will people not ask you, "Where is the whitewash you covered it with?" 
#Ez13-13: "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: In my wrath I will unleash a violent wind, and in my anger hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with destructive fury. 
#Ez13-14: I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and will level it to the ground so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it "falls, you will be destroyed in it; and you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez13-15: So I will pour out my wrath against the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash. I will say to you, "The wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it, 
#Ez13-16: those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Sovereign LORD."' 
#Ez13-17: "Now, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them 
#Ez13-18: and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their heads in order to ensnare people. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own? 
#Ez13-19: You have profaned me among my people for a few handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to my people, who listen to lies, you have killed those who should not have died and have spared those who should not live. 
#Ez13-20: "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds and I will tear them from your arms; I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds. 
#Ez13-21: I will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands, and they will no longer fall prey to your power. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez13-22: Because you disheartened the righteous with your lies, when I had brought them no grief, and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways and so save their lives, 
#Ez13-23: therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will save my people from your hands. And then you will know that I am the LORD.'"
 EZEQUIEL 14
#Ez14-1: Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me. 
#Ez14-2: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez14-3: "Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all? 
#Ez14-4: Therefore speak to them and tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When any of the Israelites set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet, I the LORD will answer them myself in keeping with their great idolatry. 
#Ez14-5: I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel, who have all deserted me for their idols.' 
#Ez14-6: "Therefore say to the people of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices! 
#Ez14-7: "'When any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing in Israel separate themselves from me and set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet to inquire of me, I the LORD will answer them myself. 
#Ez14-8: I will set my face against them and make them an example and a byword. I will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez14-9: "'And if the prophet is enticed to utter a prophecy, I the LORD have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel. 
#Ez14-10: They will bear their guilt —the prophet will be as guilty as the one who consults him. 
#Ez14-11: Then the people of Israel will no longer stray from me, nor will they defile themselves anymore with all their sins. They will be my people, and I will be their God, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" 
#Ez14-12: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez14-13: "Son of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I stretch out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and kill its people and their animals, 
#Ez14-14: even if these three men —Noah, Daniel "and Job —were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez14-15: "Or if I send wild beasts through that country and they leave it childless and it becomes desolate so that no one can pass through it because of the beasts, 
#Ez14-16: as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate. 
#Ez14-17: "Or if I bring a sword against that country and say, 'Let the sword pass throughout the land,' and I kill its people and their animals, 
#Ez14-18: as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved. 
#Ez14-19: "Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath on it through bloodshed, killing its people and their animals, 
#Ez14-20: as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness. 
#Ez14-21: "For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: How much worse will it be when I send against Jerusalem my four dreadful judgments —sword and famine and wild beasts and plague —to kill its men and their animals! 
#Ez14-22: Yet there will be some survivors —sons and daughters who will be brought out of it. They will come to you, and when you see their conduct and their actions, you will be consoled regarding the disaster I have brought on Jerusalem —every disaster I have brought on it. 
#Ez14-23: You will be consoled when you see their conduct and their actions, for you will know that I have done nothing in it without cause, declares the Sovereign LORD."

#Ez15-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez15-2: "Son of man, how is the wood of a vine different from that of a branch from any of the trees in the forest? 
#Ez15-3: Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on? 
#Ez15-4: And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? 
#Ez15-5: If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred? 
#Ez15-6: "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. 
#Ez15-7: I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez15-8: I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign LORD."
 EZEQUIEL 16
#Ez16-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez16-2: "Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices 
#Ez16-3: and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. 
#Ez16-4: On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. 
#Ez16-5: No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised. 
#Ez16-6: "'Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, "Live!" [^1] 
#Ez16-7: I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew and developed and entered puberty. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, yet you were stark naked. 
#Ez16-8: "'Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your naked body. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign LORD, and you became mine. 
#Ez16-9: "'I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. 
#Ez16-10: I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments. 
#Ez16-11: I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck, 
#Ez16-12: and I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. 
#Ez16-13: So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was honey, olive oil and the finest flour. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen. 
#Ez16-14: And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez16-15: "'But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his. 
#Ez16-16: You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. You went to him, and he possessed your beauty. [^2] 
#Ez16-17: You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. 
#Ez16-18: And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. 
#Ez16-19: Also the food I provided for you —the flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat —you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez16-20: "'And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? 
#Ez16-21: You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. 
#Ez16-22: In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood. 
#Ez16-23: "'Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign LORD. In addition to all your other wickedness, 
#Ez16-24: you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. 
#Ez16-25: At every street corner you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. 
#Ez16-26: You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors with large genitals, and aroused my anger with your increasing promiscuity. 
#Ez16-27: So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. 
#Ez16-28: You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied. 
#Ez16-29: Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, "a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied. 
#Ez16-30: "'I am filled with fury against you, "declares the Sovereign LORD, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute! 
#Ez16-31: When you built your mounds at every street corner and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment. 
#Ez16-32: "'You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband! 
#Ez16-33: All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. 
#Ez16-34: So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you. 
#Ez16-35: "'Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD! 
#Ez16-36: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you poured out your lust and exposed your naked body in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children's blood, 
#Ez16-37: therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see you stark naked. 
#Ez16-38: I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. 
#Ez16-39: Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you stark naked. 
#Ez16-40: They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords. 
#Ez16-41: They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers. 
#Ez16-42: Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry. 
#Ez16-43: "'Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head what you have done, declares the Sovereign LORD. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices? 
#Ez16-44: "'Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: "Like mother, like daughter." 
#Ez16-45: You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. 
#Ez16-46: Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom. 
#Ez16-47: You not only followed their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. 
#Ez16-48: As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done. 
#Ez16-49: "'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. 
#Ez16-50: They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. 
#Ez16-51: Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done. 
#Ez16-52: Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous. 
#Ez16-53: "'However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them, 
#Ez16-54: so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort. 
#Ez16-55: And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before. 
#Ez16-56: You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride, 
#Ez16-57: before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom "and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines —all those around you who despise you. 
#Ez16-58: You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the LORD. 
#Ez16-59: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant. 
#Ez16-60: Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
#Ez16-61: Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you. 
#Ez16-62: So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez16-63: Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign LORD.'"
 EZEQUIEL 17
#Ez17-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez17-2: "Son of man, set forth an allegory and tell it to the Israelites as a parable. 
#Ez17-3: Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: A great eagle with powerful wings, long feathers and full plumage of varied colors came to Lebanon. Taking hold of the top of a cedar, 
#Ez17-4: he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants, where he planted it in a city of traders. 
#Ez17-5: "'He took one of the seedlings of the land and put it in fertile soil. He planted it like a willow by abundant water, 
#Ez17-6: and it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine. Its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy boughs. 
#Ez17-7: "'But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage. The vine now sent out its roots toward him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water. 
#Ez17-8: It had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce branches, bear fruit and become a splendid vine.' 
#Ez17-9: "Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Will it thrive? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots. 
#Ez17-10: It has been planted, but will it thrive? Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it —wither away in the plot where it grew?'" 
#Ez17-11: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez17-12: "Say to this rebellious people, 'Do you not know what these things mean?' Say to them: 'The king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and carried off her king and her nobles, bringing them back with him to Babylon. 
#Ez17-13: Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him, putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land, 
#Ez17-14: so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving only by keeping his treaty. 
#Ez17-15: But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the treaty and yet escape? 
#Ez17-16: "'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, he shall die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose treaty he broke. 
#Ez17-17: Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in war, when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives. 
#Ez17-18: He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Because he had given his hand in pledge and yet did all these things, he shall not escape. 
#Ez17-19: "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As surely as I live, I will repay him for despising my oath and breaking my covenant. 
#Ez17-20: I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there because he was unfaithful to me. 
#Ez17-21: All his choice troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to the winds. Then you will know that I the LORD have spoken. 
#Ez17-22: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it; I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high and lofty mountain. 
#Ez17-23: On the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it; it will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in it; they will find shelter in the shade of its branches. 
#Ez17-24: All the trees of the forest will know that I the LORD bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. "'I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.'"
 EZEQUIEL 18
#Ez18-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez18-2: "What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel: "'The parents eat sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge'? 
#Ez18-3: "As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel. 
#Ez18-4: For everyone belongs to me, the parent as well as the child —both alike belong to me. The one who sins is the one who will die. 
#Ez18-5: "Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right. 
#Ez18-6: He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife or have sexual relations with a woman during her period. 
#Ez18-7: He does not oppress anyone, but returns what he took in pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked. 
#Ez18-8: He does not lend to them at interest or take a profit from them. He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between two parties. 
#Ez18-9: He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous; he will surely live, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez18-10: "Suppose he has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these other things [^1] 
#Ez18-11: (though the father has done none of them): "He eats at the mountain shrines. He defiles his neighbor's wife. 
#Ez18-12: He oppresses the poor and needy. He commits robbery. He does not return what he took in pledge. He looks to the idols. He does detestable things. 
#Ez18-13: He lends at interest and takes a profit. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he is to be put to death; his blood will be on his own head. 
#Ez18-14: "But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things: 
#Ez18-15: "He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife. 
#Ez18-16: He does not oppress anyone or require a pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked. 
#Ez18-17: He withholds his hand from mistreating the poor and takes no interest or profit from them. He keeps my laws and follows my decrees. He will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live. 
#Ez18-18: But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people. 
#Ez18-19: "Yet you ask, 'Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?' Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live. 
#Ez18-20: The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them. 
#Ez18-21: "But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will surely live; they will not die. 
#Ez18-22: None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live. 
#Ez18-23: Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? 
#Ez18-24: "But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live? None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of and because of the sins they have committed, they will die. 
#Ez18-25: "Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear, you Israelites: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust? 
#Ez18-26: If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, they will die for it; because of the sin they have committed they will die. 
#Ez18-27: But if a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life. 
#Ez18-28: Because they consider all the offenses they have committed and turn away from them, that person will surely live; they will not die. 
#Ez18-29: Yet the Israelites say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Are my ways unjust, people of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust? 
#Ez18-30: "Therefore, you Israelites, I will judge each of you according to your own ways, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall. 
#Ez18-31: Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, people of Israel? 
#Ez18-32: For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live!

#Ez19-1: "Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel 
#Ez19-2: and say: "'What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among them and reared her cubs. 
#Ez19-3: She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he became a man-eater. 
#Ez19-4: The nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt. 
#Ez19-5: "'When she saw her hope unfulfilled, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion. 
#Ez19-6: He prowled among the lions, for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he became a man-eater. 
#Ez19-7: He broke down "their strongholds and devastated their towns. The land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring. 
#Ez19-8: Then the nations came against him, those from regions round about. They spread their net for him, and he was trapped in their pit. 
#Ez19-9: With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison, so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel. 
#Ez19-10: "'Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard "planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water. 
#Ez19-11: Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler's scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage, conspicuous for its height and for its many branches. 
#Ez19-12: But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel, it was stripped of its fruit; its strong branches withered and fire consumed them. 
#Ez19-13: Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land. 
#Ez19-14: Fire spread from one of its main "branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler's scepter.' "This is a lament and is to be used as a lament."
 EZEQUIEL 20
#Ez20-1: In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and they sat down in front of me. 
#Ez20-2: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez20-3: "Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live, I will not let you inquire of me, declares the Sovereign LORD.' 
#Ez20-4: "Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man? Then confront them with the detestable practices of their ancestors 
#Ez20-5: and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them, "I am the LORD your God." 
#Ez20-6: On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands. 
#Ez20-7: And I said to them, "Each of you, get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God." 
#Ez20-8: "'But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt. 
#Ez20-9: But for the sake of my name, I brought them out of Egypt. I did it to keep my name from being profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites. 
#Ez20-10: Therefore I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
#Ez20-11: I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws, by which the person who obeys them will live. 
#Ez20-12: Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the LORD made them holy. 
#Ez20-13: "'Yet the people of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not follow my decrees but rejected my laws —by which the person who obeys them will live —and they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and destroy them in the wilderness. 
#Ez20-14: But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 
#Ez20-15: Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had given them —a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands — 
#Ez20-16: because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols. 
#Ez20-17: Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the wilderness. 
#Ez20-18: I said to their children in the wilderness, "Do not follow the statutes of your parents or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols. 
#Ez20-19: I am the LORD your God; follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 
#Ez20-20: Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God." 
#Ez20-21: "'But the children rebelled against me: They did not follow my decrees, they were not careful to keep my laws, of which I said, "The person who obeys them will live by them," and they desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness. 
#Ez20-22: But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 
#Ez20-23: Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries, 
#Ez20-24: because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes lusted after their parents' idols. 
#Ez20-25: So I gave them other statutes that were not good and laws through which they could not live; 
#Ez20-26: I defiled them through their gifts —the sacrifice of every firstborn —that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the LORD.' 
#Ez20-27: "Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In this also your ancestors blasphemed me by being unfaithful to me: 
#Ez20-28: When I brought them into the land I had sworn to give them and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices, made offerings that aroused my anger, presented their fragrant incense and poured out their drink offerings. 
#Ez20-29: Then I said to them: What is this high place you go to?'" (It is called Bamah "to this day.) 
#Ez20-30: "Therefore say to the Israelites: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Will you defile yourselves the way your ancestors did and lust after their vile images? 
#Ez20-31: When you offer your gifts —the sacrifice of your children in the fire —you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. Am I to let you inquire of me, you Israelites? As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will not let you inquire of me. 
#Ez20-32: "'You say, "We want to be like the nations, like the peoples of the world, who serve wood and stone." But what you have in mind will never happen.

#Ez20-34: I will bring you from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered —with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath. 
#Ez20-35: I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations and there, face to face, I will execute judgment upon you. 
#Ez20-36: As I judged your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez20-37: I will take note of you as you pass under my rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. 
#Ez20-38: I will purge you of those who revolt and rebel against me. Although I will bring them out of the land where they are living, yet they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez20-39: "'As for you, people of Israel, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Go and serve your idols, every one of you! But afterward you will surely listen to me and no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and idols. 
#Ez20-40: For on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD, there in the land all the people of Israel will serve me, and there I will accept them. There I will require your offerings and your choice gifts, "along with all your holy sacrifices. 
#Ez20-41: I will accept you as fragrant incense when I bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will be proved holy through you in the sight of the nations. 
#Ez20-42: Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land I had sworn with uplifted hand to give to your ancestors. 
#Ez20-43: There you will remember your conduct and all the actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil you have done. 
#Ez20-44: You will know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake and not according to your evil ways and your corrupt practices, you people of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" 
#Ez20-45: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez20-46: "Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south and prophesy against the forest of the southland. 
#Ez20-47: Say to the southern forest: 'Hear the word of the LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to set fire to you, and it will consume all your trees, both green and dry. The blazing flame will not be quenched, and every face from south to north will be scorched by it. 
#Ez20-48: Everyone will see that I the LORD have kindled it; it will not be quenched.'" 
#Ez20-49: Then I said, "Sovereign LORD, they are saying of me, 'Isn't he just telling parables?'" [^3]
 EZEQUIEL 21
#Ez21-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez21-2: "Son of man, set your face against Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuary. Prophesy against the land of Israel 
#Ez21-3: and say to her: 'This is what the LORD says: I am against you. I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked. 
#Ez21-4: Because I am going to cut off the righteous and the wicked, my sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north. 
#Ez21-5: Then all people will know that I the LORD have drawn my sword from its sheath; it will not return again.' 
#Ez21-6: "Therefore groan, son of man! Groan before them with broken heart and bitter grief. 
#Ez21-7: And when they ask you, 'Why are you groaning?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt with fear and every hand go limp; every spirit will become faint and every leg will be wet with urine.' It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign LORD." 
#Ez21-8: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez21-9: "Son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Lord says: "'A sword, a sword, sharpened and polished — 
#Ez21-10: sharpened for the slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! "'Shall we rejoice in the scepter of my royal son? The sword despises every such stick. 
#Ez21-11: "'The sword is appointed to be polished, to be grasped with the hand; it is sharpened and polished, made ready for the hand of the slayer. 
#Ez21-12: Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel. They are thrown to the sword along with my people. Therefore beat your breast. 
#Ez21-13: "'Testing will surely come. And what if even the scepter, which the sword despises, does not continue? declares the Sovereign LORD.' 
#Ez21-14: "So then, son of man, prophesy and strike your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times. It is a sword for slaughter — a sword for great slaughter, closing in on them from every side. 
#Ez21-15: So that hearts may melt with fear and the fallen be many, I have stationed the sword for slaughter "at all their gates. Look! It is forged to strike like lightning, it is grasped for slaughter. 
#Ez21-16: Slash to the right, you sword, then to the left, wherever your blade is turned. 
#Ez21-17: I too will strike my hands together, and my wrath will subside. I the LORD have spoken." 
#Ez21-18: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez21-19: "Son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take, both starting from the same country. Make a signpost where the road branches off to the city. 
#Ez21-20: Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites and another against Judah and fortified Jerusalem. 
#Ez21-21: For the king of Babylon will stop at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: He will cast lots with arrows, he will consult his idols, he will examine the liver. 
#Ez21-22: Into his right hand will come the lot for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to give the command to slaughter, to sound the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp and to erect siege works. 
#Ez21-23: It will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to him, but he will remind them of their guilt and take them captive. 
#Ez21-24: "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'Because you people have brought to mind your guilt by your open rebellion, revealing your sins in all that you do —because you have done this, you will be taken captive. 
#Ez21-25: "'You profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose time of punishment has reached its climax, 
#Ez21-26: this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Take off the turban, remove the crown. It will not be as it was: The lowly will be exalted and the exalted will be brought low. 
#Ez21-27: A ruin! A ruin! I will make it a ruin! The crown will not be restored until he to whom it rightfully belongs shall come; to him I will give it.' 
#Ez21-28: "And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says about the Ammonites and their insults: "'A sword, a sword, drawn for the slaughter, polished to consume and to flash like lightning! 
#Ez21-29: Despite false visions concerning you and lying divinations about you, it will be laid on the necks of the wicked who are to be slain, whose day has come, whose time of punishment has reached its climax. 
#Ez21-30: "'Let the sword return to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your ancestry, I will judge you. 
#Ez21-31: I will pour out my wrath on you and breathe out my fiery anger against you; I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men, men skilled in destruction. 
#Ez21-32: You will be fuel for the fire, your blood will be shed in your land, you will be remembered no more; for I the LORD have spoken.'"
 EZEQUIEL 22
#Ez22-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez22-2: "Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices 
#Ez22-3: and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols, 
#Ez22-4: you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries. 
#Ez22-5: Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, you infamous city, full of turmoil. 
#Ez22-6: "'See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood. 
#Ez22-7: In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the foreigner and mistreated the fatherless and the widow. 
#Ez22-8: You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths. 
#Ez22-9: In you are slanderers who are bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts. 
#Ez22-10: In you are those who dishonor their father's bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean. 
#Ez22-11: In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor's wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father's daughter. 
#Ez22-12: In you are people who accept bribes to shed blood; you take interest and make a profit from the poor. You extort unjust gain from your neighbors. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez22-13: "'I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst. 
#Ez22-14: Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it. 
#Ez22-15: I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness. 
#Ez22-16: When you have been defiled "in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.'" 
#Ez22-17: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez22-18: "Son of man, the people of Israel have become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver. 
#Ez22-19: Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem. 
#Ez22-20: As silver, copper, iron, lead and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you. 
#Ez22-21: I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her. 
#Ez22-22: As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath on you.'" 
#Ez22-23: Again the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez22-24: "Son of man, say to the land, 'You are a land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.' 
#Ez22-25: There is a conspiracy of her princes "within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her. 
#Ez22-26: Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. 
#Ez22-27: Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain. 
#Ez22-28: Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says' —when the LORD has not spoken. 
#Ez22-29: The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice. 
#Ez22-30: "I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one. 
#Ez22-31: So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD."
 EZEQUIEL 23
#Ez23-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez23-2: "Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother. 
#Ez23-3: They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed. 
#Ez23-4: The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. 
#Ez23-5: "Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians —warriors 
#Ez23-6: clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen. 
#Ez23-7: She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. 
#Ez23-8: She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her. 
#Ez23-9: "Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted. 
#Ez23-10: They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her. 
#Ez23-11: "Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister. 
#Ez23-12: She too lusted after the Assyrians —governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men. 
#Ez23-13: I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way. 
#Ez23-14: "But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans "portrayed in red, 
#Ez23-15: with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea. [^2] 
#Ez23-16: As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 
#Ez23-17: Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. 
#Ez23-18: When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. 
#Ez23-19: Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. 
#Ez23-20: There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. 
#Ez23-21: So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled. [^3] 
#Ez23-22: "Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side — 
#Ez23-23: the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. 
#Ez23-24: They will come against you with weapons, "chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards. 
#Ez23-25: I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire. 
#Ez23-26: They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry. 
#Ez23-27: So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore. 
#Ez23-28: "For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to deliver you into the hands of those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust. 
#Ez23-29: They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you stark naked, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity 
#Ez23-30: have brought this on you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. 
#Ez23-31: You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand. 
#Ez23-32: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "You will drink your sister's cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much. 
#Ez23-33: You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria. 
#Ez23-34: You will drink it and drain it dry and chew on its pieces — and you will tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez23-35: "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution." 
#Ez23-36: The LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices, 
#Ez23-37: for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them. 
#Ez23-38: They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths. 
#Ez23-39: On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house. 
#Ez23-40: "They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, applied eye makeup and put on your jewelry. 
#Ez23-41: You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and olive oil that belonged to me. 
#Ez23-42: "The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the wrists of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads. 
#Ez23-43: Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, 'Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.' 
#Ez23-44: And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah. 
#Ez23-45: But righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands. 
#Ez23-46: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder. 
#Ez23-47: The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses. 
#Ez23-48: "So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you. 
#Ez23-49: You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD."
 EZEQUIEL 24
#Ez24-1: In the ninth year, in the tenth month on the tenth day, the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez24-2: "Son of man, record this date, this very date, because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. 
#Ez24-3: Tell this rebellious people a parable and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'Put on the cooking pot; put it on and pour water into it. 
#Ez24-4: Put into it the pieces of meat, all the choice pieces —the leg and the shoulder. Fill it with the best of these bones; 
#Ez24-5: take the pick of the flock. Pile wood beneath it for the bones; bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it. 
#Ez24-6: "'For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'Woe to the city of bloodshed, to the pot now encrusted, whose deposit will not go away! Take the meat out piece by piece in whatever order it comes. 
#Ez24-7: "'For the blood she shed is in her midst: She poured it on the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground, where the dust would cover it. 
#Ez24-8: To stir up wrath and take revenge I put her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered. 
#Ez24-9: "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'Woe to the city of bloodshed! I, too, will pile the wood high. 
#Ez24-10: So heap on the wood and kindle the fire. Cook the meat well, mixing in the spices; and let the bones be charred. 
#Ez24-11: Then set the empty pot on the coals till it becomes hot and its copper glows, so that its impurities may be melted and its deposit burned away. 
#Ez24-12: It has frustrated all efforts; its heavy deposit has not been removed, not even by fire. 
#Ez24-13: "'Now your impurity is lewdness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed from your impurity, you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided. 
#Ez24-14: "'I the LORD have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back; I will not have pity, nor will I relent. You will be judged according to your conduct and your actions, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" 
#Ez24-15: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez24-16: "Son of man, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears. 
#Ez24-17: Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners." 
#Ez24-18: So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded. 
#Ez24-19: Then the people asked me, "Won't you tell us what these things have to do with us? Why are you acting like this?" 
#Ez24-20: So I said to them, "The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez24-21: Say to the people of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to desecrate my sanctuary —the stronghold in which you take pride, the delight of your eyes, the object of your affection. The sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword. 
#Ez24-22: And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners. 
#Ez24-23: You will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep but will waste away because of "your sins and groan among yourselves. 
#Ez24-24: Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.' 
#Ez24-25: "And you, son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes, their heart's desire, and their sons and daughters as well — 
#Ez24-26: on that day a fugitive will come to tell you the news. 
#Ez24-27: At that time your mouth will be opened; you will speak with him and will no longer be silent. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD."
 EZEQUIEL 25
#Ez25-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez25-2: "Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them. 
#Ez25-3: Say to them, 'Hear the word of the Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you said "Aha!" over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah when they went into exile, 
#Ez25-4: therefore I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk. 
#Ez25-5: I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and Ammon into a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez25-6: For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, rejoicing with all the malice of your heart against the land of Israel, 
#Ez25-7: therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will wipe you out from among the nations and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the LORD.'" 
#Ez25-8: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'Because Moab and Seir said, "Look, Judah has become like all the other nations," 
#Ez25-9: therefore I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns —Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim —the glory of that land. 
#Ez25-10: I will give Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations; 
#Ez25-11: and I will inflict punishment on Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'" 
#Ez25-12: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'Because Edom took revenge on Judah and became very guilty by doing so, 
#Ez25-13: therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and kill both man and beast. I will lay it waste, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword. 
#Ez25-14: I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom in accordance with my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" 
#Ez25-15: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts, and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah, 
#Ez25-16: therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will wipe out the Kerethites and destroy those remaining along the coast. 
#Ez25-17: I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I take vengeance on them.'"
 EZEQUIEL 26
#Ez26-1: In the eleventh month of the twelfth "year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez26-2: "Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, 'Aha! The gate to the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me; now that she lies in ruins I will prosper,' 
#Ez26-3: therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves. 
#Ez26-4: They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock. 
#Ez26-5: Out in the sea she will become a place to spread fishnets, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. She will become plunder for the nations, 
#Ez26-6: and her settlements on the mainland will be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez26-7: "For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: From the north I am going to bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar "king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with horsemen and a great army. 
#Ez26-8: He will ravage your settlements on the mainland with the sword; he will set up siege works against you, build a ramp up to your walls and raise his shields against you. 
#Ez26-9: He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons. 
#Ez26-10: His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your walls will tremble at the noise of the warhorses, wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been broken through. 
#Ez26-11: The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. 
#Ez26-12: They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea. 
#Ez26-13: I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more. 
#Ez26-14: I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread fishnets. You will never be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez26-15: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place in you? 
#Ez26-16: Then all the princes of the coast will step down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and take off their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on the ground, trembling every moment, appalled at you. 
#Ez26-17: Then they will take up a lament concerning you and say to you: "'How you are destroyed, city of renown, peopled by men of the sea! You were a power on the seas, you and your citizens; you put your terror on all who lived there. 
#Ez26-18: Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall; the islands in the sea are terrified at your collapse.' 
#Ez26-19: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When I make you a desolate city, like cities no longer inhabited, and when I bring the ocean depths over you and its vast waters cover you, 
#Ez26-20: then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of long ago. I will make you dwell in the earth below, as in ancient ruins, with those who go down to the pit, and you will not return or take your place "in the land of the living. 
#Ez26-21: I will bring you to a horrible end and you will be no more. You will be sought, but you will never again be found, declares the Sovereign LORD."

#Ez27-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez27-2: "Son of man, take up a lament concerning Tyre. 
#Ez27-3: Say to Tyre, situated at the gateway to the sea, merchant of peoples on many coasts, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'You say, Tyre, "I am perfect in beauty."

#Ez27-6: Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; of cypress wood "from the coasts of Cyprus they made your deck, adorned with ivory. 
#Ez27-7: Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail and served as your banner; your awnings were of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah. 
#Ez27-8: Men of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen; your skilled men, Tyre, were aboard as your sailors. 
#Ez27-9: Veteran craftsmen of Byblos were on board as shipwrights to caulk your seams. All the ships of the sea and their sailors came alongside to trade for your wares. 
#Ez27-10: "'Men of Persia, Lydia and Put served as soldiers in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls, bringing you splendor.

#Ez27-33: When your merchandise went out on the seas, you satisfied many nations; with your great wealth and your wares you enriched the kings of the earth. 
#Ez27-34: Now you are shattered by the sea in the depths of the waters; your wares and all your company have gone down with you. 
#Ez27-35: All who live in the coastlands are appalled at you; their kings shudder with horror and their faces are distorted with fear.

#Ez28-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez28-2: "Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'In the pride of your heart you say, "I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas." But you are a mere mortal and not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god.

#Ez28-4: By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries. 
#Ez28-5: By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, and because of your wealth your heart has grown proud.

#Ez28-11: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez28-12: "Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.

#Ez28-14: You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones. 
#Ez28-15: You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you. 
#Ez28-16: Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones. 
#Ez28-17: Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings. 
#Ez28-18: By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.

#Ez29-1: In the tenth year, in the tenth month on the twelfth day, the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez29-2: "Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. 
#Ez29-3: Speak to him and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, you great monster lying among your streams. You say, "The Nile belongs to me; I made it for myself." 
#Ez29-4: But I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. I will pull you out from among your streams, with all the fish sticking to your scales. 
#Ez29-5: I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open field and not be gathered or picked up. I will give you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky.

#Ez29-10: therefore I am against you and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from Migdol to Aswan, as far as the border of Cush. [^2] 
#Ez29-11: The foot of neither man nor beast will pass through it; no one will live there for forty years. 
#Ez29-12: I will make the land of Egypt desolate among devastated lands, and her cities will lie desolate forty years among ruined cities. And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries. 
#Ez29-13: "'Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered. 
#Ez29-14: I will bring them back from captivity and return them to Upper Egypt, the land of their ancestry. There they will be a lowly kingdom. 
#Ez29-15: It will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations. 
#Ez29-16: Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the people of Israel but will be a reminder of their sin in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.'" 
#Ez29-17: In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez29-18: "Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon drove his army in a hard campaign against Tyre; every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw. Yet he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre. 
#Ez29-19: Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will carry off its wealth. He will loot and plunder the land as pay for his army. 
#Ez29-20: I have given him Egypt as a reward for his efforts because he and his army did it for me, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez29-21: "On that day I will make a horn "grow for the Israelites, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD."

#Ez30-20: In the eleventh year, in the first month on the seventh day, the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez30-21: "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. It has not been bound up to be healed or put in a splint so that it may become strong enough to hold a sword. 
#Ez30-22: Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. I will break both his arms, the good arm as well as the broken one, and make the sword fall from his hand. 
#Ez30-23: I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries. 
#Ez30-24: I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him like a mortally wounded man.

 EZEQUIEL 31
#Ez31-1: In the eleventh year, in the third month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez31-2: "Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes: "'Who can be compared with you in majesty? 
#Ez31-3: Consider Assyria, once a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest; it towered on high, its top above the thick foliage. 
#Ez31-4: The waters nourished it, deep springs made it grow tall; their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field. 
#Ez31-5: So it towered higher than all the trees of the field; its boughs increased and its branches grew long, spreading because of abundant waters. 
#Ez31-6: All the birds of the air nested in its boughs, all the beasts of the field gave birth under its branches; all the great nations lived in its shade. 
#Ez31-7: It was majestic in beauty, with its spreading boughs, for its roots went down to abundant waters. 
#Ez31-8: The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor could the pine trees equal its boughs, nor could the plane trees compare with its branches- no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty. 
#Ez31-9: I made it beautiful with abundant branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God. 
#Ez31-10: "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because it towered on high, lifting its top above the thick foliage, and because it was proud of its height, 
#Ez31-11: I handed it over to the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with according to its wickedness. I cast it aside, 
#Ez31-12: and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it. Its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys; its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it. 
#Ez31-13: All the birds of the air settled on the fallen tree, and all the beasts of the field were among its branches. 
#Ez31-14: Therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high, lifting their tops above the thick foliage. No other trees so well-watered are ever to reach such a height; they are all destined for death, for the earth below, among mortal men, with those who go down to the pit. 
#Ez31-15: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day it was brought down to the grave I covered the deep springs with mourning for it; I held back its streams, and its abundant waters were restrained. Because of it I clothed Lebanon with gloom, and all the trees of the field withered away. 
#Ez31-16: I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to the grave with those who go down to the pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, all the trees that were well-watered, were consoled in the earth below. 
#Ez31-17: Those who lived in its shade, its allies among the nations, had also gone down to the grave with it, joining those killed by the sword. 
#Ez31-18: "'Which of the trees of Eden can be compared with you in splendor and majesty? Yet you, too, will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth below; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword. "'This is Pharaoh and all his hordes, declares the Sovereign LORD.'"

#Ez32-1: In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez32-2: "Son of man, take up a lament concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: "'You are like a lion among the nations; you are like a monster in the seas thrashing about in your streams, churning the water with your feet and muddying the streams.

#Ez32-5: I will spread your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains. 
#Ez32-6: I will drench the land with your flowing blood all the way to the mountains, and the ravines will be filled with your flesh. 
#Ez32-7: When I snuff you out, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light. 
#Ez32-8: All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you; I will bring darkness over your land, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez32-9: I will trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring about your destruction among the nations, among "lands you have not known. 
#Ez32-10: I will cause many peoples to be appalled at you, and their kings will shudder with horror because of you when I brandish my sword before them. On the day of your downfall each of them will tremble every moment for his life.

#Ez32-15: When I make Egypt desolate and strip the land of everything in it, when I strike down all who live there, then they will know that I am the LORD.' 
#Ez32-16: "This is the lament they will chant for her. The daughters of the nations will chant it; for Egypt and all her hordes they will chant it, declares the Sovereign LORD." 
#Ez32-17: In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez32-18: "Son of man, wail for the hordes of Egypt and consign to the earth below both her and the daughters of mighty nations, along with those who go down to the pit. 
#Ez32-19: Say to them, 'Are you more favored than others? Go down and be laid among the uncircumcised.' 
#Ez32-20: They will fall among those killed by the sword. The sword is drawn; let her be dragged off with all her hordes. 
#Ez32-21: From within the realm of the dead the mighty leaders will say of Egypt and her allies, 'They have come down and they lie with the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.' 
#Ez32-22: "Assyria is there with her whole army; she is surrounded by the graves of all her slain, all who have fallen by the sword.

#Ez32-24: "Elam is there, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword. All who had spread terror in the land of the living went down uncircumcised to the earth below. They bear their shame with those who go down to the pit. 
#Ez32-25: A bed is made for her among the slain, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword. Because their terror had spread in the land of the living, they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit; they are laid among the slain. 
#Ez32-26: "Meshek and Tubal are there, with all their hordes around their graves. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword because they spread their terror in the land of the living.

 EZEQUIEL 33
#Ez33-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez33-2: "Son of man, speak to your people and say to them: 'When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman, 
#Ez33-3: and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people, 
#Ez33-4: then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not heed the warning and the sword comes and takes their life, their blood will be on their own head. 
#Ez33-5: Since they heard the sound of the trumpet but did not heed the warning, their blood will be on their own head. If they had heeded the warning, they would have saved themselves. 
#Ez33-6: But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone's life, that person's life will be taken because of their sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.' 
#Ez33-7: "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. 
#Ez33-8: When I say to the wicked, 'You wicked person, you will surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways, that wicked person will die for "their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. 
#Ez33-9: But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, though you yourself will be saved. 
#Ez33-10: "Son of man, say to the Israelites, 'This is what you are saying: "Our offenses and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away because of "them. How then can we live?"' 
#Ez33-11: Say to them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?' 
#Ez33-12: "Therefore, son of man, say to your people, 'If someone who is righteous disobeys, that person's former righteousness will count for nothing. And if someone who is wicked repents, that person's former wickedness will not bring condemnation. The righteous person who sins will not be allowed to live even though they were formerly righteous.' 
#Ez33-13: If I tell a righteous person that they will surely live, but then they trust in their righteousness and do evil, none of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered; they will die for the evil they have done. 
#Ez33-14: And if I say to a wicked person, 'You will surely die,' but they then turn away from their sin and do what is just and right — 
#Ez33-15: if they give back what they took in pledge for a loan, return what they have stolen, follow the decrees that give life, and do no evil —that person will surely live; they will not die. 
#Ez33-16: None of the sins that person has committed will be remembered against them. They have done what is just and right; they will surely live. 
#Ez33-17: "Yet your people say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' But it is their way that is not just. 
#Ez33-18: If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, they will die for it. 
#Ez33-19: And if a wicked person turns away from their wickedness and does what is just and right, they will live by doing so. 
#Ez33-20: Yet you Israelites say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' But I will judge each of you according to your own ways." 
#Ez33-21: In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month on the fifth day, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has fallen!" 
#Ez33-22: Now the evening before the man arrived, the hand of the LORD was on me, and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent. 
#Ez33-23: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez33-24: "Son of man, the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, 'Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as our possession.' 
#Ez33-25: Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood, should you then possess the land? 
#Ez33-26: You rely on your sword, you do detestable things, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife. Should you then possess the land?' 
#Ez33-27: "Say this to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: As surely as I live, those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword, those out in the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague. 
#Ez33-28: I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them. 
#Ez33-29: Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done.' 
#Ez33-30: "As for you, son of man, your people are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, 'Come and hear the message that has come from the LORD.' 
#Ez33-31: My people come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to hear your words, but they do not put them into practice. Their mouths speak of love, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain. 
#Ez33-32: Indeed, to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but do not put them into practice. 
#Ez33-33: "When all this comes true —and it surely will —then they will know that a prophet has been among them."
 EZEQUIEL 34
#Ez34-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez34-2: "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? 
#Ez34-3: You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. 
#Ez34-4: You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. 
#Ez34-5: So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals. 
#Ez34-6: My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. 
#Ez34-7: "'Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: 
#Ez34-8: As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock, 
#Ez34-9: therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: 
#Ez34-10: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them. 
#Ez34-11: "'For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. 
#Ez34-12: As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. 
#Ez34-13: I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land. 
#Ez34-14: I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 
#Ez34-15: I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez34-16: I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice. 
#Ez34-17: "'As for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will judge between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats. 
#Ez34-18: Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? 
#Ez34-19: Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet? 
#Ez34-20: "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says to them: See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. 
#Ez34-21: Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away, 
#Ez34-22: I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will judge between one sheep and another. 
#Ez34-23: I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd. 
#Ez34-24: I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the LORD have spoken. 
#Ez34-25: "'I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of savage beasts so that they may live in the wilderness and sleep in the forests in safety. 
#Ez34-26: I will make them and the places surrounding my hill a blessing. "I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing. 
#Ez34-27: The trees will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them. 
#Ez34-28: They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid. 
#Ez34-29: I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations. 
#Ez34-30: Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them and that they, the Israelites, are my people, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez34-31: You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Sovereign LORD.'"
 EZEQUIEL 35
#Ez35-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez35-2: "Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it 
#Ez35-3: and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste. 
#Ez35-4: I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez35-5: "'Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax, 
#Ez35-6: therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you. 
#Ez35-7: I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go. 
#Ez35-8: I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines. 
#Ez35-9: I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez35-10: "'Because you have said, "These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them," even though I the LORD was there, 
#Ez35-11: therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. 
#Ez35-12: Then you will know that I the LORD have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, "They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour." 
#Ez35-13: You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it. 
#Ez35-14: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. 
#Ez35-15: Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of Israel became desolate, that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'"
 EZEQUIEL 36
#Ez36-1: "Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, 'Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD. 
#Ez36-2: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: The enemy said of you, "Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession."' 
#Ez36-3: Therefore prophesy and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because they ravaged and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of people's malicious talk and slander, 
#Ez36-4: therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign LORD: This is what the Sovereign LORD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered and ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you — 
#Ez36-5: this is what the Sovereign LORD says: In my burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, for with glee and with malice in their hearts they made my land their own possession so that they might plunder its pastureland.' 
#Ez36-6: Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I speak in my jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations. 
#Ez36-7: Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I swear with uplifted hand that the nations around you will also suffer scorn. 
#Ez36-8: "'But you, mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my people Israel, for they will soon come home. 
#Ez36-9: I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor; you will be plowed and sown, 
#Ez36-10: and I will cause many people to live on you —yes, all of Israel. The towns will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. 
#Ez36-11: I will increase the number of people and animals living on you, and they will be fruitful and become numerous. I will settle people on you as in the past and will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez36-12: I will cause people, my people Israel, to live on you. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance; you will never again deprive them of their children. 
#Ez36-13: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because some say to you, "You devour people and deprive your nation of its children," 
#Ez36-14: therefore you will no longer devour people or make your nation childless, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez36-15: No longer will I make you hear the taunts of the nations, and no longer will you suffer the scorn of the peoples or cause your nation to fall, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" 
#Ez36-16: Again the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez36-17: "Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land, they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their conduct was like a woman's monthly uncleanness in my sight. 
#Ez36-18: So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols. 
#Ez36-19: I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered through the countries; I judged them according to their conduct and their actions. 
#Ez36-20: And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for it was said of them, 'These are the LORD's people, and yet they had to leave his land.' 
#Ez36-21: I had concern for my holy name, which the people of Israel profaned among the nations where they had gone. 
#Ez36-22: "Therefore say to the Israelites, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: It is not for your sake, people of Israel, that I am going to do these things, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone. 
#Ez36-23: I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Sovereign LORD, when I am proved holy through you before their eyes. 
#Ez36-24: "'For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land. 
#Ez36-25: I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. 
#Ez36-26: I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 
#Ez36-27: And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 
#Ez36-28: Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God. 
#Ez36-29: I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you. 
#Ez36-30: I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field, so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine. 
#Ez36-31: Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices. 
#Ez36-32: I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, declares the Sovereign LORD. Be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct, people of Israel! 
#Ez36-33: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt. 
#Ez36-34: The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it. 
#Ez36-35: They will say, "This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited." 
#Ez36-36: Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the LORD have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.' 
#Ez36-37: "This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Once again I will yield to Israel's plea and do this for them: I will make their people as numerous as sheep, 
#Ez36-38: as numerous as the flocks for offerings at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals. So will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
 EZEQUIEL 37
#Ez37-1: The hand of the LORD was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 
#Ez37-2: He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 
#Ez37-3: He asked me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" I said, "Sovereign LORD, you alone know." 
#Ez37-4: Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones and say to them, 'Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! 
#Ez37-5: This is what the Sovereign LORD says to these bones: I will make breath "enter you, and you will come to life. 
#Ez37-6: I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'" 
#Ez37-7: So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 
#Ez37-8: I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them. 
#Ez37-9: Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.'" 
#Ez37-10: So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet —a vast army. 
#Ez37-11: Then he said to me: "Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.' 
#Ez37-12: Therefore prophesy and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. 
#Ez37-13: Then you, my people, will know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. 
#Ez37-14: I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the LORD have spoken, and I have done it, declares the LORD.'" 
#Ez37-15: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez37-16: "Son of man, take a stick of wood and write on it, 'Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with him.' Then take another stick of wood, and write on it, 'Belonging to Joseph (that is, to Ephraim) and all the Israelites associated with him.' 
#Ez37-17: Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your hand. 
#Ez37-18: "When your people ask you, 'Won't you tell us what you mean by this?' 
#Ez37-19: say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to take the stick of Joseph —which is in Ephraim's hand —and of the Israelite tribes associated with him, and join it to Judah's stick. I will make them into a single stick of wood, and they will become one in my hand.' 
#Ez37-20: Hold before their eyes the sticks you have written on 
#Ez37-21: and say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them back into their own land. 
#Ez37-22: I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. There will be one king over all of them and they will never again be two nations or be divided into two kingdoms. 
#Ez37-23: They will no longer defile themselves with their idols and vile images or with any of their offenses, for I will save them from all their sinful backsliding, "and I will cleanse them. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
#Ez37-24: "'My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees. 
#Ez37-25: They will live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob, the land where your ancestors lived. They and their children and their children's children will live there forever, and David my servant will be their prince forever. 
#Ez37-26: I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and increase their numbers, and I will put my sanctuary among them forever. 
#Ez37-27: My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
#Ez37-28: Then the nations will know that I the LORD make Israel holy, when my sanctuary is among them forever.'"
 EZEQUIEL 38
#Ez38-1: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Ez38-2: "Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of "Meshek and Tubal; prophesy against him 
#Ez38-3: and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of "Meshek and Tubal. 
#Ez38-4: I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your whole army —your horses, your horsemen fully armed, and a great horde with large and small shields, all of them brandishing their swords. 
#Ez38-5: Persia, Cush "and Put will be with them, all with shields and helmets, 
#Ez38-6: also Gomer with all its troops, and Beth Togarmah from the far north with all its troops —the many nations with you. 
#Ez38-7: "'Get ready; be prepared, you and all the hordes gathered about you, and take command of them. 
#Ez38-8: After many days you will be called to arms. In future years you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety. 
#Ez38-9: You and all your troops and the many nations with you will go up, advancing like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land. 
#Ez38-10: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On that day thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil scheme. 
#Ez38-11: You will say, "I will invade a land of unwalled villages; I will attack a peaceful and unsuspecting people —all of them living without walls and without gates and bars. 
#Ez38-12: I will plunder and loot and turn my hand against the resettled ruins and the people gathered from the nations, rich in livestock and goods, living at the center of the land. "" 
#Ez38-13: Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all her villages "will say to you, "Have you come to plunder? Have you gathered your hordes to loot, to carry off silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods and to seize much plunder?"' 
#Ez38-14: "Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In that day, when my people Israel are living in safety, will you not take notice of it? 
#Ez38-15: You will come from your place in the far north, you and many nations with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army. 
#Ez38-16: You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In days to come, Gog, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I am proved holy through you before their eyes. 
#Ez38-17: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You are the one I spoke of in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel. At that time they prophesied for years that I would bring you against them. 
#Ez38-18: This is what will happen in that day: When Gog attacks the land of Israel, my hot anger will be aroused, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez38-19: In my zeal and fiery wrath I declare that at that time there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. 
#Ez38-20: The fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the beasts of the field, every creature that moves along the ground, and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs will crumble and every wall will fall to the ground. 
#Ez38-21: I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign LORD. Every man's sword will be against his brother. 
#Ez38-22: I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him. 
#Ez38-23: And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'
 EZEQUIEL 39
#Ez39-1: "Son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of "Meshek and Tubal. 
#Ez39-2: I will turn you around and drag you along. I will bring you from the far north and send you against the mountains of Israel. 
#Ez39-3: Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand. 
#Ez39-4: On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals. 
#Ez39-5: You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez39-6: I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in safety in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the LORD. 
#Ez39-7: "'I will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no longer let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that I the LORD am the Holy One in Israel. 
#Ez39-8: It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign LORD. This is the day I have spoken of. 
#Ez39-9: "'Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them up —the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel. 
#Ez39-10: They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests, because they will use the weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez39-11: "'On that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of those who travel east of the Sea. It will block the way of travelers, because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog. [^2] 
#Ez39-12: "'For seven months the Israelites will be burying them in order to cleanse the land. 
#Ez39-13: All the people of the land will bury them, and the day I display my glory will be a memorable day for them, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez39-14: People will be continually employed in cleansing the land. They will spread out across the land and, along with others, they will bury any bodies that are lying on the ground. "'After the seven months they will carry out a more detailed search. 
#Ez39-15: As they go through the land, anyone who sees a human bone will leave a marker beside it until the gravediggers bury it in the Valley of Hamon Gog, 
#Ez39-16: near a town called Hamonah. "And so they will cleanse the land.' 
#Ez39-17: "Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Call out to every kind of bird and all the wild animals: 'Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood. 
#Ez39-18: You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth as if they were rams and lambs, goats and bulls —all of them fattened animals from Bashan. 
#Ez39-19: At the sacrifice I am preparing for you, you will eat fat till you are glutted and drink blood till you are drunk. 
#Ez39-20: At my table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, mighty men and soldiers of every kind,' declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez39-21: "I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the punishment I inflict and the hand I lay on them. 
#Ez39-22: From that day forward the people of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God. 
#Ez39-23: And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for their sin, because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword. 
#Ez39-24: I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offenses, and I hid my face from them. 
#Ez39-25: "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will now restore the fortunes of Jacob "and will have compassion on all the people of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name. 
#Ez39-26: They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid. 
#Ez39-27: When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of many nations. 
#Ez39-28: Then they will know that I am the LORD their God, for though I sent them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving any behind. 
#Ez39-29: I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the people of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD."
 EZEQUIEL 40
#Ez40-1: In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city —on that very day the hand of the LORD was on me and he took me there. 
#Ez40-2: In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city. 
#Ez40-3: He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. 
#Ez40-4: The man said to me, "Son of man, look carefully and listen closely and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the people of Israel everything you see." 
#Ez40-5: I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the man's hand was six long cubits, "each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one measuring rod thick and one rod high. 
#Ez40-6: Then he went to the east gate. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep. 
#Ez40-7: The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits "thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep. 
#Ez40-8: Then he measured the portico of the gateway; 
#Ez40-9: it "was eight cubits "deep and its jambs were two cubits "thick. The portico of the gateway faced the temple. 
#Ez40-10: Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements. 
#Ez40-11: Then he measured the width of the entrance of the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits. [^6] 
#Ez40-12: In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square. 
#Ez40-13: Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits "from one parapet opening to the opposite one. 
#Ez40-14: He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway —sixty cubits. "The measurement was up to the portico "facing the courtyard. [^10] 
#Ez40-15: The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits. [^11] 
#Ez40-16: The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees. 
#Ez40-17: Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement. 
#Ez40-18: It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement. 
#Ez40-19: Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits "on the east side as well as on the north. 
#Ez40-20: Then he measured the length and width of the north gate, leading into the outer court. 
#Ez40-21: Its alcoves —three on each side —its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
#Ez40-22: Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. 
#Ez40-23: There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits. 
#Ez40-24: Then he led me to the south side and I saw the south gate. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. 
#Ez40-25: The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
#Ez40-26: Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them; it had palm tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side. 
#Ez40-27: The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits. 
#Ez40-28: Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others. 
#Ez40-29: Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
#Ez40-30: (The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.) 
#Ez40-31: Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it. 
#Ez40-32: Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others. 
#Ez40-33: Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
#Ez40-34: Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it. 
#Ez40-35: Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others, 
#Ez40-36: as did its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico, and it had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
#Ez40-37: Its portico "faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it. 
#Ez40-38: A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed. 
#Ez40-39: In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings "and guilt offerings were slaughtered. 
#Ez40-40: By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance of the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables. 
#Ez40-41: So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other —eight tables in all —on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. 
#Ez40-42: There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high. "On them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices. 
#Ez40-43: And double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth "long, were attached to the wall all around. The tables were for the flesh of the offerings. 
#Ez40-44: Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one "at the side of the north gate and facing south, and another at the side of the south "gate and facing north. 
#Ez40-45: He said to me, "The room facing south is for the priests who guard the temple, 
#Ez40-46: and the room facing north is for the priests who guard the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the LORD to minister before him." 
#Ez40-47: Then he measured the court: It was square —a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple. 
#Ez40-48: He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits "and its projecting walls were "three cubits "wide on either side. 
#Ez40-49: The portico was twenty cubits "wide, and twelve "cubits "from front to back. It was reached by a flight of stairs, "and there were pillars on each side of the jambs.
 EZEQUIEL 41
#Ez41-1: Then the man brought me to the main hall and measured the jambs; the width of the jambs was six cubits "on each side. [^2] 
#Ez41-2: The entrance was ten cubits "wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were five cubits "wide. He also measured the main hall; it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. [^5] 
#Ez41-3: Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits "wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits "wide. 
#Ez41-4: And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place." 
#Ez41-5: Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits "wide. 
#Ez41-6: The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple. 
#Ez41-7: The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor. 
#Ez41-8: I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits. 
#Ez41-9: The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple 
#Ez41-10: and the priests' rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple. 
#Ez41-11: There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around. 
#Ez41-12: The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits "wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits. [^10] 
#Ez41-13: Then he measured the temple; it was a hundred cubits "long, and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long. 
#Ez41-14: The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits. 
#Ez41-15: Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. The main hall, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court, 
#Ez41-16: as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them —everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered. 
#Ez41-17: In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary 
#Ez41-18: were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: 
#Ez41-19: the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple. 
#Ez41-20: From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the main hall. 
#Ez41-21: The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar. 
#Ez41-22: There was a wooden altar three cubits "high and two cubits square "; its corners, its base "and its sides were of wood. The man said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD." 
#Ez41-23: Both the main hall and the Most Holy Place had double doors. 
#Ez41-24: Each door had two leaves —two hinged leaves for each door. 
#Ez41-25: And on the doors of the main hall were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front of the portico. 
#Ez41-26: On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs.
 EZEQUIEL 42
#Ez42-1: Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side. 
#Ez42-2: The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide. [^1] 
#Ez42-3: Both in the section twenty cubits "from the inner court and in the section opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at the three levels. 
#Ez42-4: In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits "long. "Their doors were on the north. 
#Ez42-5: Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building. 
#Ez42-6: The rooms on the top floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors. 
#Ez42-7: There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits. 
#Ez42-8: While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long. 
#Ez42-9: The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court. 
#Ez42-10: On the south side "along the length of the wall of the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall, were rooms 
#Ez42-11: with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north 
#Ez42-12: were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms. 
#Ez42-13: Then he said to me, "The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests' rooms, where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings —the grain offerings, the sin offerings "and the guilt offerings —for the place is holy. 
#Ez42-14: Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people." 
#Ez42-15: When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around: 
#Ez42-16: He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits. "[^8] 
#Ez42-17: He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits "by the measuring rod. 
#Ez42-18: He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. 
#Ez42-19: Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. 
#Ez42-20: So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common.
 EZEQUIEL 43
#Ez43-1: Then the man brought me to the gate facing east, 
#Ez43-2: and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing waters, and the land was radiant with his glory. 
#Ez43-3: The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he "came to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown. 
#Ez43-4: The glory of the LORD entered the temple through the gate facing east. 
#Ez43-5: Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple. 
#Ez43-6: While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple. 
#Ez43-7: He said: "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever. The people of Israel will never again defile my holy name —neither they nor their kings —by their prostitution and the funeral offerings "for their kings at their death. [^3] 
#Ez43-8: When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger. 
#Ez43-9: Now let them put away from me their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings, and I will live among them forever. 
#Ez43-10: "Son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider its perfection, 
#Ez43-11: and if they are ashamed of all they have done, make known to them the design of the temple —its arrangement, its exits and entrances —its whole design and all its regulations "and laws. Write these down before them so that they may be faithful to its design and follow all its regulations. 
#Ez43-12: "This is the law of the temple: All the surrounding area on top of the mountain will be most holy. Such is the law of the temple. 
#Ez43-13: "These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits, "that cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth: Its gutter is a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span "around the edge. And this is the height of the altar: 
#Ez43-14: From the gutter on the ground up to the lower ledge that goes around the altar it is two cubits high, and the ledge is a cubit wide. "From this lower ledge to the upper ledge that goes around the altar it is four cubits high, and that ledge is also a cubit wide. [^8] 
#Ez43-15: Above that, the altar hearth is four cubits high, and four horns project upward from the hearth. 
#Ez43-16: The altar hearth is square, twelve cubits "long and twelve cubits wide. 
#Ez43-17: The upper ledge also is square, fourteen cubits "long and fourteen cubits wide. All around the altar is a gutter of one cubit with a rim of half a cubit. "The steps of the altar face east." 
#Ez43-18: Then he said to me, "Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: These will be the regulations for sacrificing burnt offerings and splashing blood against the altar when it is built: 
#Ez43-19: You are to give a young bull as a sin offering "to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who come near to minister before me, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez43-20: You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the upper ledge and all around the rim, and so purify the altar and make atonement for it. 
#Ez43-21: You are to take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary. 
#Ez43-22: "On the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering, and the altar is to be purified as it was purified with the bull. 
#Ez43-23: When you have finished purifying it, you are to offer a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect. 
#Ez43-24: You are to offer them before the LORD, and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD. 
#Ez43-25: "For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect. 
#Ez43-26: For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; thus they will dedicate it. 
#Ez43-27: At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Sovereign LORD."
 EZEQUIEL 44
#Ez44-1: Then the man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, the one facing east, and it was shut. 
#Ez44-2: The LORD said to me, "This gate is to remain shut. It must not be opened; no one may enter through it. It is to remain shut because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it. 
#Ez44-3: The prince himself is the only one who may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the LORD. He is to enter by way of the portico of the gateway and go out the same way." 
#Ez44-4: Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. I looked and saw the glory of the LORD filling the temple of the LORD, and I fell facedown. 
#Ez44-5: The LORD said to me, "Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and give attention to everything I tell you concerning all the regulations and instructions regarding the temple of the LORD. Give attention to the entrance to the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary. 
#Ez44-6: Say to rebellious Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Enough of your detestable practices, people of Israel! 
#Ez44-7: In addition to all your other detestable practices, you brought foreigners uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary, desecrating my temple while you offered me food, fat and blood, and you broke my covenant. 
#Ez44-8: Instead of carrying out your duty in regard to my holy things, you put others in charge of my sanctuary. 
#Ez44-9: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh is to enter my sanctuary, not even the foreigners who live among the Israelites. 
#Ez44-10: "'The Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray and who wandered from me after their idols must bear the consequences of their sin. 
#Ez44-11: They may serve in my sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple and serving in it; they may slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and stand before the people and serve them. 
#Ez44-12: But because they served them in the presence of their idols and made the people of Israel fall into sin, therefore I have sworn with uplifted hand that they must bear the consequences of their sin, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez44-13: They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or my most holy offerings; they must bear the shame of their detestable practices. 
#Ez44-14: And I will appoint them to guard the temple for all the work that is to be done in it. 
#Ez44-15: "'But the Levitical priests, who are descendants of Zadok and who guarded my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, are to come near to minister before me; they are to stand before me to offer sacrifices of fat and blood, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez44-16: They alone are to enter my sanctuary; they alone are to come near my table to minister before me and serve me as guards. 
#Ez44-17: "'When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen clothes; they must not wear any woolen garment while ministering at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple. 
#Ez44-18: They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them perspire. 
#Ez44-19: When they go out into the outer court where the people are, they are to take off the clothes they have been ministering in and are to leave them in the sacred rooms, and put on other clothes, so that the people are not consecrated through contact with their garments. 
#Ez44-20: "'They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but they are to keep the hair of their heads trimmed. 
#Ez44-21: No priest is to drink wine when he enters the inner court. 
#Ez44-22: They must not marry widows or divorced women; they may marry only virgins of Israelite descent or widows of priests. 
#Ez44-23: They are to teach my people the difference between the holy and the common and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean. 
#Ez44-24: "'In any dispute, the priests are to serve as judges and decide it according to my ordinances. They are to keep my laws and my decrees for all my appointed festivals, and they are to keep my Sabbaths holy. 
#Ez44-25: "'A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person; however, if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother or unmarried sister, then he may defile himself. 
#Ez44-26: After he is cleansed, he must wait seven days. 
#Ez44-27: On the day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he is to offer a sin offering "for himself, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez44-28: "'I am to be the only inheritance the priests have. You are to give them no possession in Israel; I will be their possession. 
#Ez44-29: They will eat the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings; and everything in Israel devoted "to the LORD will belong to them. 
#Ez44-30: The best of all the firstfruits and of all your special gifts will belong to the priests. You are to give them the first portion of your ground meal so that a blessing may rest on your household. 
#Ez44-31: The priests must not eat anything, whether bird or animal, found dead or torn by wild animals.
 EZEQUIEL 45
#Ez45-1: "'When you allot the land as an inheritance, you are to present to the LORD a portion of the land as a sacred district, 25,000 cubits "long and 20,000 "cubits "wide; the entire area will be holy. 
#Ez45-2: Of this, a section 500 cubits "square is to be for the sanctuary, with 50 cubits "around it for open land. 
#Ez45-3: In the sacred district, measure off a section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits "wide. In it will be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. 
#Ez45-4: It will be the sacred portion of the land for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and who draw near to minister before the LORD. It will be a place for their houses as well as a holy place for the sanctuary. 
#Ez45-5: An area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide will belong to the Levites, who serve in the temple, as their possession for towns to live in. [^7] 
#Ez45-6: "'You are to give the city as its property an area 5,000 cubits "wide and 25,000 cubits long, adjoining the sacred portion; it will belong to all Israel. 
#Ez45-7: "'The prince will have the land bordering each side of the area formed by the sacred district and the property of the city. It will extend westward from the west side and eastward from the east side, running lengthwise from the western to the eastern border parallel to one of the tribal portions. 
#Ez45-8: This land will be his possession in Israel. And my princes will no longer oppress my people but will allow the people of Israel to possess the land according to their tribes. 
#Ez45-9: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You have gone far enough, princes of Israel! Give up your violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Stop dispossessing my people, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez45-10: You are to use accurate scales, an accurate ephah "and an accurate bath. [^10] 
#Ez45-11: The ephah and the bath are to be the same size, the bath containing a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer is to be the standard measure for both. 
#Ez45-12: The shekel "is to consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one mina. [^12] 
#Ez45-13: "'This is the special gift you are to offer: a sixth of an ephah "from each homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah "from each homer of barley. 
#Ez45-14: The prescribed portion of olive oil, measured by the bath, is a tenth of a bath "from each cor (which consists of ten baths or one homer, for ten baths are equivalent to a homer). 
#Ez45-15: Also one sheep is to be taken from every flock of two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These will be used for the grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the people, declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez45-16: All the people of the land will be required to give this special offering to the prince in Israel. 
#Ez45-17: It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings and drink offerings at the festivals, the New Moons and the Sabbaths —at all the appointed festivals of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings, "grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the Israelites. 
#Ez45-18: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In the first month on the first day you are to take a young bull without defect and purify the sanctuary. 
#Ez45-19: The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar and on the gateposts of the inner court. 
#Ez45-20: You are to do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance; so you are to make atonement for the temple. 
#Ez45-21: "'In the first month on the fourteenth day you are to observe the Passover, a festival lasting seven days, during which you shall eat bread made without yeast. 
#Ez45-22: On that day the prince is to provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land. 
#Ez45-23: Every day during the seven days of the festival he is to provide seven bulls and seven rams without defect as a burnt offering to the LORD, and a male goat for a sin offering. 
#Ez45-24: He is to provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram, along with a hin "of olive oil for each ephah. 
#Ez45-25: "'During the seven days of the festival, which begins in the seventh month on the fifteenth day, he is to make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings and oil.
 EZEQUIEL 46
#Ez46-1: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: The gate of the inner court facing east is to be shut on the six working days, but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon it is to be opened. 
#Ez46-2: The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost. The priests are to sacrifice his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings. He is to bow down in worship at the threshold of the gateway and then go out, but the gate will not be shut until evening. 
#Ez46-3: On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are to worship in the presence of the LORD at the entrance of that gateway. 
#Ez46-4: The burnt offering the prince brings to the LORD on the Sabbath day is to be six male lambs and a ram, all without defect. 
#Ez46-5: The grain offering given with the ram is to be an ephah, "and the grain offering with the lambs is to be as much as he pleases, along with a hin "of olive oil for each ephah. 
#Ez46-6: On the day of the New Moon he is to offer a young bull, six lambs and a ram, all without defect. 
#Ez46-7: He is to provide as a grain offering one ephah with the bull, one ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wants to give, along with a hin of oil for each ephah. 
#Ez46-8: When the prince enters, he is to go in through the portico of the gateway, and he is to come out the same way. 
#Ez46-9: "'When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed festivals, whoever enters by the north gate to worship is to go out the south gate; and whoever enters by the south gate is to go out the north gate. No one is to return through the gate by which they entered, but each is to go out the opposite gate. 
#Ez46-10: The prince is to be among them, going in when they go in and going out when they go out. 
#Ez46-11: At the feasts and the appointed festivals, the grain offering is to be an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as he pleases, along with a hin of oil for each ephah. 
#Ez46-12: "'When the prince provides a freewill offering to the LORD —whether a burnt offering or fellowship offerings —the gate facing east is to be opened for him. He shall offer his burnt offering or his fellowship offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out, the gate will be shut. 
#Ez46-13: "'Every day you are to provide a year-old lamb without defect for a burnt offering to the LORD; morning by morning you shall provide it. 
#Ez46-14: You are also to provide with it morning by morning a grain offering, consisting of a sixth of an ephah "with a third of a hin "of oil to moisten the flour. The presenting of this grain offering to the LORD is a lasting ordinance. 
#Ez46-15: So the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering. 
#Ez46-16: "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: If the prince makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his sons, it will also belong to his descendants; it is to be their property by inheritance. 
#Ez46-17: If, however, he makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, the servant may keep it until the year of freedom; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs to his sons only; it is theirs. 
#Ez46-18: The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people, driving them off their property. He is to give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that not one of my people will be separated from their property.'" 
#Ez46-19: Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the sacred rooms facing north, which belonged to the priests, and showed me a place at the western end. 
#Ez46-20: He said to me, "This is the place where the priests are to cook the guilt offering and the sin offering "and bake the grain offering, to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people." 
#Ez46-21: He then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw in each corner another court. 
#Ez46-22: In the four corners of the outer court were enclosed "courts, forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide; "each of the courts in the four corners was the same size. 
#Ez46-23: Around the inside of each of the four courts was a ledge of stone, with places for fire built all around under the ledge. 
#Ez46-24: He said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple are to cook the sacrifices of the people."
 EZEQUIEL 47
#Ez47-1: The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple, and I saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar. 
#Ez47-2: He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and the water was trickling from the south side. 
#Ez47-3: As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits "and then led me through water that was ankle-deep. 
#Ez47-4: He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was knee-deep. He measured off another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist. 
#Ez47-5: He measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in —a river that no one could cross. 
#Ez47-6: He asked me, "Son of man, do you see this?" Then he led me back to the bank of the river. 
#Ez47-7: When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river. 
#Ez47-8: He said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, "where it enters the Dead Sea. When it empties into the sea, the salty water there becomes fresh. 
#Ez47-9: Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live. 
#Ez47-10: Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds —like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea. 
#Ez47-11: But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt. 
#Ez47-12: Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing." 
#Ez47-13: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "These are the boundaries of the land that you will divide among the twelve tribes of Israel as their inheritance, with two portions for Joseph. 
#Ez47-14: You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it to your ancestors, this land will become your inheritance. 
#Ez47-15: "This is to be the boundary of the land: "On the north side it will run from the Mediterranean Sea by the Hethlon road past Lebo Hamath to Zedad, 
#Ez47-16: Berothah "and Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer Hattikon, which is on the border of Hauran. 
#Ez47-17: The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan, "along the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern boundary. 
#Ez47-18: "On the east side the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the Dead Sea and as far as Tamar. "This will be the eastern boundary. 
#Ez47-19: "On the south side it will run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern boundary. 
#Ez47-20: "On the west side, the Mediterranean Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the western boundary. 
#Ez47-21: "You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 
#Ez47-22: You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners residing among you and who have children. You are to consider them as native-born Israelites; along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 
#Ez47-23: In whatever tribe a foreigner resides, there you are to give them their inheritance," declares the Sovereign LORD.
 EZEQUIEL 48
#Ez48-1: "These are the tribes, listed by name: At the northern frontier, Dan will have one portion; it will follow the Hethlon road to Lebo Hamath; Hazar Enan and the northern border of Damascus next to Hamath will be part of its border from the east side to the west side. 
#Ez48-2: "Asher will have one portion; it will border the territory of Dan from east to west. 
#Ez48-3: "Naphtali will have one portion; it will border the territory of Asher from east to west. 
#Ez48-4: "Manasseh will have one portion; it will border the territory of Naphtali from east to west. 
#Ez48-5: "Ephraim will have one portion; it will border the territory of Manasseh from east to west. 
#Ez48-6: "Reuben will have one portion; it will border the territory of Ephraim from east to west. 
#Ez48-7: "Judah will have one portion; it will border the territory of Reuben from east to west. 
#Ez48-8: "Bordering the territory of Judah from east to west will be the portion you are to present as a special gift. It will be 25,000 cubits "wide, and its length from east to west will equal one of the tribal portions; the sanctuary will be in the center of it. 
#Ez48-9: "The special portion you are to offer to the LORD will be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits "wide. 
#Ez48-10: This will be the sacred portion for the priests. It will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side, 10,000 cubits wide on the west side, 10,000 cubits wide on the east side and 25,000 cubits long on the south side. In the center of it will be the sanctuary of the LORD. 
#Ez48-11: This will be for the consecrated priests, the Zadokites, who were faithful in serving me and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray. 
#Ez48-12: It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, bordering the territory of the Levites. 
#Ez48-13: "Alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. Its total length will be 25,000 cubits and its width 10,000 cubits. 
#Ez48-14: They must not sell or exchange any of it. This is the best of the land and must not pass into other hands, because it is holy to the LORD. 
#Ez48-15: "The remaining area, 5,000 cubits "wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for the common use of the city, for houses and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it 
#Ez48-16: and will have these measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits, "the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits. 
#Ez48-17: The pastureland for the city will be 250 cubits "on the north, 250 cubits on the south, 250 cubits on the east, and 250 cubits on the west. 
#Ez48-18: What remains of the area, bordering on the sacred portion and running the length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city. 
#Ez48-19: The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel. 
#Ez48-20: The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits on each side. As a special gift you will set aside the sacred portion, along with the property of the city. 
#Ez48-21: "What remains on both sides of the area formed by the sacred portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince. It will extend eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the sacred portion to the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. Both these areas running the length of the tribal portions will belong to the prince, and the sacred portion with the temple sanctuary will be in the center of them. 
#Ez48-22: So the property of the Levites and the property of the city will lie in the center of the area that belongs to the prince. The area belonging to the prince will lie between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin. 
#Ez48-23: "As for the rest of the tribes: Benjamin will have one portion; it will extend from the east side to the west side. 
#Ez48-24: "Simeon will have one portion; it will border the territory of Benjamin from east to west. 
#Ez48-25: "Issachar will have one portion; it will border the territory of Simeon from east to west. 
#Ez48-26: "Zebulun will have one portion; it will border the territory of Issachar from east to west. 
#Ez48-27: "Gad will have one portion; it will border the territory of Zebulun from east to west. 
#Ez48-28: "The southern boundary of Gad will run south from Tamar to the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. 
#Ez48-29: "This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions," declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Ez48-30: "These will be the exits of the city: Beginning on the north side, which is 4,500 cubits long, 
#Ez48-31: the gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel. The three gates on the north side will be the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah and the gate of Levi. 
#Ez48-32: "On the east side, which is 4,500 cubits long, will be three gates: the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin and the gate of Dan. 
#Ez48-33: "On the south side, which measures 4,500 cubits, will be three gates: the gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar and the gate of Zebulun. 
#Ez48-34: "On the west side, which is 4,500 cubits long, will be three gates: the gate of Gad, the gate of Asher and the gate of Naphtali. 
#Ez48-35: "The distance all around will be 18,000 cubits. ""And the name of the city from that time on will be: THE LORD IS THERE."
DANIEL
 DANIEL 1
#Dn1-1: In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
#Dn1-2: And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia "and put in the treasure house of his god. 
#Dn1-3: Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring into the king's service some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility — 
#Dn1-4: young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians. [^2] 
#Dn1-5: The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king's service. 
#Dn1-6: Among those who were chosen were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 
#Dn1-7: The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego. 
#Dn1-8: But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way. 
#Dn1-9: Now God had caused the official to show favor and compassion to Daniel, 
#Dn1-10: but the official told Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your "food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you." 
#Dn1-11: Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, 
#Dn1-12: "Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
#Dn1-13: Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see." 
#Dn1-14: So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days. 
#Dn1-15: At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. 
#Dn1-16: So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead. 
#Dn1-17: To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds. 
#Dn1-18: At the end of the time set by the king to bring them into his service, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. 
#Dn1-19: The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service. 
#Dn1-20: In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom. 
#Dn1-21: And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
 DANIEL 2
#Dn2-1: In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep. 
#Dn2-2: So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers "to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king, 
#Dn2-3: he said to them, "I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. "" 
#Dn2-4: Then the astrologers answered the king, ""May the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it." 
#Dn2-5: The king replied to the astrologers, "This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. 
#Dn2-6: But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me." 
#Dn2-7: Once more they replied, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it." 
#Dn2-8: Then the king answered, "I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: 
#Dn2-9: If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me." 
#Dn2-10: The astrologers answered the king, "There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. 
#Dn2-11: What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans." 
#Dn2-12: This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. 
#Dn2-13: So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death. 
#Dn2-14: When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. 
#Dn2-15: He asked the king's officer, "Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. 
#Dn2-16: At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him. 
#Dn2-17: Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 
#Dn2-18: He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
#Dn2-19: During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven 
#Dn2-20: and said: "Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his. 
#Dn2-21: He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. 
#Dn2-22: He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him. 
#Dn2-23: I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king." 
#Dn2-24: Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him." 
#Dn2-25: Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means." 
#Dn2-26: The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?" 
#Dn2-27: Daniel replied, "No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, 
#Dn2-28: but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these: 
#Dn2-29: "As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. 
#Dn2-30: As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind. 
#Dn2-31: "Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue —an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 
#Dn2-32: The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 
#Dn2-33: its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 
#Dn2-34: While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 
#Dn2-35: Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth. 
#Dn2-36: "This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. 
#Dn2-37: Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; 
#Dn2-38: in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. 
#Dn2-39: "After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. 
#Dn2-40: Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron —for iron breaks and smashes everything —and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. 
#Dn2-41: Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. 
#Dn2-42: As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. 
#Dn2-43: And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay. 
#Dn2-44: "In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. 
#Dn2-45: This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands —a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. "The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy." 
#Dn2-46: Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. 
#Dn2-47: The king said to Daniel, "Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery." 
#Dn2-48: Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. 
#Dn2-49: Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
 DANIEL 3
#Dn3-1: King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, "and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 
#Dn3-2: He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up. 
#Dn3-3: So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it. 
#Dn3-4: Then the herald loudly proclaimed, "Nations and peoples of every language, this is what you are commanded to do: 
#Dn3-5: As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
#Dn3-6: Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace." 
#Dn3-7: Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
#Dn3-8: At this time some astrologers "came forward and denounced the Jews. 
#Dn3-9: They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "May the king live forever! 
#Dn3-10: Your Majesty has issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold, 
#Dn3-11: and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. 
#Dn3-12: But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon —Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego —who pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up." 
#Dn3-13: Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king, 
#Dn3-14: and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up? 
#Dn3-15: Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?" 
#Dn3-16: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him, "King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. 
#Dn3-17: If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us "from Your Majesty's hand. 
#Dn3-18: But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up." 
#Dn3-19: Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual 
#Dn3-20: and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. 
#Dn3-21: So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace. 
#Dn3-22: The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, 
#Dn3-23: and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace. 
#Dn3-24: Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, "Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?" They replied, "Certainly, Your Majesty." 
#Dn3-25: He said, "Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods." 
#Dn3-26: Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire, 
#Dn3-27: and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them. 
#Dn3-28: Then Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. 
#Dn3-29: Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way." 
#Dn3-30: Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
 DANIEL 4
#Dn4-1: King Nebuchadnezzar, To the nations and peoples of every language, who live in all the earth: May you prosper greatly! 
#Dn4-2: It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me. 
#Dn4-3: How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion endures from generation to generation. 
#Dn4-4: I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous. 
#Dn4-5: I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me. 
#Dn4-6: So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me. 
#Dn4-7: When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers "and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me. 
#Dn4-8: Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.) 
#Dn4-9: I said, "Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me. 
#Dn4-10: These are the visions I saw while lying in bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous. 
#Dn4-11: The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth. 
#Dn4-12: Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the wild animals found shelter, and the birds lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed. 
#Dn4-13: "In the visions I saw while lying in bed, I looked, and there before me was a holy one, a messenger, "coming down from heaven. 
#Dn4-14: He called in a loud voice: 'Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches. 
#Dn4-15: But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field. "'Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth. 
#Dn4-16: Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times "pass by for him. 
#Dn4-17: "'The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of people.' 
#Dn4-18: "This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you." 
#Dn4-19: Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, "Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you." Belteshazzar answered, "My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries! 
#Dn4-20: The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth, 
#Dn4-21: with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the wild animals, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds — 
#Dn4-22: Your Majesty, you are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth. 
#Dn4-23: "Your Majesty saw a holy one, a messenger, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live with the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.' 
#Dn4-24: "This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king: 
#Dn4-25: You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes. 
#Dn4-26: The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules. 
#Dn4-27: Therefore, Your Majesty, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue." 
#Dn4-28: All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
#Dn4-29: Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, 
#Dn4-30: he said, "Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?" 
#Dn4-31: Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from heaven, "This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you. 
#Dn4-32: You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes." 
#Dn4-33: Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like the ox. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird. 
#Dn4-34: At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation. 
#Dn4-35: All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: "What have you done?" 
#Dn4-36: At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before. 
#Dn4-37: Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble.
 DANIEL 5
#Dn5-1: King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them. 
#Dn5-2: While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father "had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them. 
#Dn5-3: So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them. 
#Dn5-4: As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone. 
#Dn5-5: Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote. 
#Dn5-6: His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking. 
#Dn5-7: The king summoned the enchanters, astrologers "and diviners. Then he said to these wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom." 
#Dn5-8: Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant. 
#Dn5-9: So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled. 
#Dn5-10: The queen, "hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. "May the king live forever!" she said. "Don't be alarmed! Don't look so pale! 
#Dn5-11: There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners. 
#Dn5-12: He did this because Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means." 
#Dn5-13: So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, "Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah? 
#Dn5-14: I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom. 
#Dn5-15: The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it. 
#Dn5-16: Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom." 
#Dn5-17: Then Daniel answered the king, "You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means. 
#Dn5-18: "Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor. 
#Dn5-19: Because of the high position he gave him, all the nations and peoples of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled. 
#Dn5-20: But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. 
#Dn5-21: He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes. 
#Dn5-22: "But you, Belshazzar, his son, "have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this. 
#Dn5-23: Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways. 
#Dn5-24: Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription. 
#Dn5-25: "This is the inscription that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN 
#Dn5-26: "Here is what these words mean: ": God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. 
#Dn5-27: : You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. 
#Dn5-28: : Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians." 
#Dn5-29: Then at Belshazzar's command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom. 
#Dn5-30: That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, "was slain, 
#Dn5-31: and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two. [^9]
 DANIEL 6
#Dn6-1: It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom, 
#Dn6-2: with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss. 
#Dn6-3: Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 
#Dn6-4: At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. 
#Dn6-5: Finally these men said, "We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God." 
#Dn6-6: So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: "May King Darius live forever! 
#Dn6-7: The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions' den. 
#Dn6-8: Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered —in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed." 
#Dn6-9: So King Darius put the decree in writing. 
#Dn6-10: Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. 
#Dn6-11: Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. 
#Dn6-12: So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: "Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions' den?" The king answered, "The decree stands —in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed." 
#Dn6-13: Then they said to the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day." 
#Dn6-14: When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him. 
#Dn6-15: Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, "Remember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed." 
#Dn6-16: So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!" 
#Dn6-17: A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel's situation might not be changed. 
#Dn6-18: Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep. 
#Dn6-19: At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions' den. 
#Dn6-20: When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?" 
#Dn6-21: Daniel answered, "May the king live forever! 
#Dn6-22: My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, Your Majesty." 
#Dn6-23: The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. 
#Dn6-24: At the king's command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions' den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones. 
#Dn6-25: Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth: "May you prosper greatly! 
#Dn6-26: "I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. "For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end. 
#Dn6-27: He rescues and he saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions." 
#Dn6-28: So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus "the Persian.
 DANIEL 7
#Dn7-1: In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream. 
#Dn7-2: Daniel said: "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. 
#Dn7-3: Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. 
#Dn7-4: "The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it. 
#Dn7-5: "And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' 
#Dn7-6: "After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. 
#Dn7-7: "After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast —terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. 
#Dn7-8: "While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully. 
#Dn7-9: "As I looked, "thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. 
#Dn7-10: A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. 
#Dn7-11: "Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. 
#Dn7-12: (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) 
#Dn7-13: "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, "coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. 
#Dn7-14: He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. 
#Dn7-15: "I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. 
#Dn7-16: I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this. "So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: 
#Dn7-17: 'The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth. 
#Dn7-18: But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever —yes, for ever and ever.' 
#Dn7-19: "Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws —the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. 
#Dn7-20: I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell —the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. 
#Dn7-21: As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, 
#Dn7-22: until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. 
#Dn7-23: "He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. 
#Dn7-24: The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. 
#Dn7-25: He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time. [^2] 
#Dn7-26: "'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. 
#Dn7-27: Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' 
#Dn7-28: "This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself."
 DANIEL 8
#Dn8-1: In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me. 
#Dn8-2: In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. 
#Dn8-3: I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. 
#Dn8-4: I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great. 
#Dn8-5: As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. 
#Dn8-6: It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage. 
#Dn8-7: I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power. 
#Dn8-8: The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven. 
#Dn8-9: Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. 
#Dn8-10: It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them. 
#Dn8-11: It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the LORD; it took away the daily sacrifice from the LORD, and his sanctuary was thrown down. 
#Dn8-12: Because of rebellion, the LORD's people "and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground. 
#Dn8-13: Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, "How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled —the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot of the LORD's people?" 
#Dn8-14: He said to me, "It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated." 
#Dn8-15: While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. 
#Dn8-16: And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai calling, "Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision." 
#Dn8-17: As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. "Son of man," "he said to me, "understand that the vision concerns the time of the end." 
#Dn8-18: While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet. 
#Dn8-19: He said: "I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end. [^3] 
#Dn8-20: The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. 
#Dn8-21: The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king. 
#Dn8-22: The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power. 
#Dn8-23: "In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise. 
#Dn8-24: He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. 
#Dn8-25: He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power. 
#Dn8-26: "The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future." 
#Dn8-27: I, Daniel, was worn out. I lay exhausted for several days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.
 DANIEL 9
#Dn9-1: In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes "(a Mede by descent), who was made ruler over the Babylonian "kingdom — 
#Dn9-2: in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the LORD given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years. 
#Dn9-3: So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes. 
#Dn9-4: I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed: "Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, 
#Dn9-5: we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. 
#Dn9-6: We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land. 
#Dn9-7: "Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame —the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you. 
#Dn9-8: We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, LORD, because we have sinned against you. 
#Dn9-9: The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him; 
#Dn9-10: we have not obeyed the LORD our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets. 
#Dn9-11: All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you. "Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you. 
#Dn9-12: You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. 
#Dn9-13: Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth. 
#Dn9-14: The LORD did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the LORD our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him. 
#Dn9-15: "Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong. 
#Dn9-16: Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us. 
#Dn9-17: "Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary. 
#Dn9-18: Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. 
#Dn9-19: Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name." 
#Dn9-20: While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the LORD my God for his holy hill — 
#Dn9-21: while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice. 
#Dn9-22: He instructed me and said to me, "Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding. 
#Dn9-23: As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision: 
#Dn9-24: "Seventy 'sevens' "are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish "transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place. [^5] 
#Dn9-25: "Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, "the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens,' and sixty-two 'sevens.' It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. 
#Dn9-26: After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. "The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. 
#Dn9-27: He will confirm a covenant with many for one 'seven.' "In the middle of the 'seven' "he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple "he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him. "" [^12]
 DANIEL 10
#Dn10-1: In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war. "The understanding of the message came to him in a vision. 
#Dn10-2: At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. 
#Dn10-3: I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over. 
#Dn10-4: On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, 
#Dn10-5: I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. 
#Dn10-6: His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude. 
#Dn10-7: I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; those who were with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves. 
#Dn10-8: So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless. 
#Dn10-9: Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground. 
#Dn10-10: A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. 
#Dn10-11: He said, "Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you." And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling. 
#Dn10-12: Then he continued, "Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. 
#Dn10-13: But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. 
#Dn10-14: Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come." 
#Dn10-15: While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless. 
#Dn10-16: Then one who looked like a man "touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, "I am overcome with anguish because of the vision, my lord, and I feel very weak. 
#Dn10-17: How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe." 
#Dn10-18: Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength. 
#Dn10-19: "Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed," he said. "Peace! Be strong now; be strong." When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength." 
#Dn10-20: So he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece will come; 
#Dn10-21: but first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince.
 DANIEL 11
#Dn11-1: And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I took my stand to support and protect him.) 
#Dn11-2: "Now then, I tell you the truth: Three more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power by his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece. 
#Dn11-3: Then a mighty king will arise, who will rule with great power and do as he pleases. 
#Dn11-4: After he has arisen, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others. 
#Dn11-5: "The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power. 
#Dn11-6: After some years, they will become allies. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an alliance, but she will not retain her power, and he and his power "will not last. In those days she will be betrayed, together with her royal escort and her father "and the one who supported her. 
#Dn11-7: "One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress; he will fight against them and be victorious. 
#Dn11-8: He will also seize their gods, their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the North alone. 
#Dn11-9: Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country. 
#Dn11-10: His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress. 
#Dn11-11: "Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be defeated. 
#Dn11-12: When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant. 
#Dn11-13: For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a huge army fully equipped. 
#Dn11-14: "In those times many will rise against the king of the South. Those who are violent among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success. 
#Dn11-15: Then the king of the North will come and build up siege ramps and will capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand. 
#Dn11-16: The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land and will have the power to destroy it. 
#Dn11-17: He will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the South. And he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans "will not succeed or help him. 
#Dn11-18: Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back on him. 
#Dn11-19: After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more. 
#Dn11-20: "His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle. 
#Dn11-21: "He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue. 
#Dn11-22: Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed. 
#Dn11-23: After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power. 
#Dn11-24: When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses —but only for a time. 
#Dn11-25: "With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him. 
#Dn11-26: Those who eat from the king's provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle. 
#Dn11-27: The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time. 
#Dn11-28: The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country. 
#Dn11-29: "At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before. 
#Dn11-30: Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant. 
#Dn11-31: "His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation. 
#Dn11-32: With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him. 
#Dn11-33: "Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered. 
#Dn11-34: When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them. 
#Dn11-35: Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time. 
#Dn11-36: "The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place. 
#Dn11-37: He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all. 
#Dn11-38: Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. 
#Dn11-39: He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price. [^4] 
#Dn11-40: "At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. 
#Dn11-41: He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand. 
#Dn11-42: He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape. 
#Dn11-43: He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites "in submission. 
#Dn11-44: But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 
#Dn11-45: He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at "the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
 DANIEL 12
#Dn12-1: "At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people —everyone whose name is found written in the book —will be delivered. 
#Dn12-2: Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. 
#Dn12-3: Those who are wise "will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever. 
#Dn12-4: But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge." 
#Dn12-5: Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank. 
#Dn12-6: One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?" 
#Dn12-7: The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, "It will be for a time, times and half a time. "When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed." 
#Dn12-8: I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, "My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?" 
#Dn12-9: He replied, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end. 
#Dn12-10: Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand. 
#Dn12-11: "From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. 
#Dn12-12: Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days. 
#Dn12-13: "As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance."
OSÉIAS
 OSÉIAS 1
#Os1-1: The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash "king of Israel: 
#Os1-2: When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, "Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the LORD." 
#Os1-3: So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. 
#Os1-4: Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel. 
#Os1-5: In that day I will break Israel's bow in the Valley of Jezreel." 
#Os1-6: Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call her Lo-Ruhamah (which means "not loved"), for I will no longer show love to Israel, that I should at all forgive them. 
#Os1-7: Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them —not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the LORD their God, will save them." 
#Os1-8: After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son. 
#Os1-9: Then the LORD said, "Call him Lo-Ammi (which means "not my people"), for you are not my people, and I am not your God. [^2] 
#Os1-10: "Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'children of the living God.' 
#Os1-11: The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel. [^3]
 OSÉIAS 2
#Os2-1: "Say of your brothers, 'My people,' and of your sisters, 'My loved one.' 
#Os2-2: "Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts. 
#Os2-3: Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst. 
#Os2-4: I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery. 
#Os2-5: Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink.' 
#Os2-6: Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way. 
#Os2-7: She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, 'I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.' 
#Os2-8: She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold — which they used for Baal. 
#Os2-9: "Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her naked body. 
#Os2-10: So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will take her out of my hands. 
#Os2-11: I will stop all her celebrations: her yearly festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days —all her appointed festivals. 
#Os2-12: I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them. 
#Os2-13: I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot," declares the LORD. 
#Os2-14: "Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her. 
#Os2-15: There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor "a door of hope. There she will respond "as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt. 
#Os2-16: "In that day," declares the LORD, "you will call me 'my husband'; you will no longer call me 'my master. "' 
#Os2-17: I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked. 
#Os2-18: In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety. 
#Os2-19: I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in "righteousness and justice, in "love and compassion. 
#Os2-20: I will betroth you in "faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD. 
#Os2-21: "In that day I will respond," declares the LORD — "I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth; 
#Os2-22: and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, and they will respond to Jezreel. [^8] 
#Os2-23: I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called 'Not my loved one. "' I will say to those called 'Not my people, "' 'You are my people'; and they will say, 'You are my God.'"
 OSÉIAS 3
#Os3-1: The LORD said to me, "Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another man and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes." 
#Os3-2: So I bought her for fifteen shekels "of silver and about a homer and a lethek "of barley. 
#Os3-3: Then I told her, "You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will behave the same way toward you." 
#Os3-4: For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods. 
#Os3-5: Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the LORD and to his blessings in the last days.
 OSÉIAS 4
#Os4-1: Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: "There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land. 
#Os4-2: There is only cursing, "lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed. 
#Os4-3: Because of this the land dries up, and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea are swept away. 
#Os4-4: "But let no one bring a charge, let no one accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest. 
#Os4-5: You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother — 
#Os4-6: my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. "Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children. 
#Os4-7: The more priests there were, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged their glorious God "for something disgraceful. 
#Os4-8: They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness. 
#Os4-9: And it will be: Like people, like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds. 
#Os4-10: "They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not flourish, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves 
#Os4-11: to prostitution; old wine and new wine take away their understanding. 
#Os4-12: My people consult a wooden idol, and a diviner's rod speaks to them. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God. 
#Os4-13: They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery. 
#Os4-14: "I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes — a people without understanding will come to ruin! 
#Os4-15: "Though you, Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty. "Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven. "And do not swear, 'As surely as the LORD lives!' 
#Os4-16: The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the LORD pasture them like lambs in a meadow? 
#Os4-17: Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone! 
#Os4-18: Even when their drinks are gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways. 
#Os4-19: A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.
 OSÉIAS 5
#Os5-1: "Hear this, you priests! Pay attention, you Israelites! Listen, royal house! This judgment is against you: You have been a snare at Mizpah, a net spread out on Tabor. 
#Os5-2: The rebels are knee-deep in slaughter. I will discipline all of them. 
#Os5-3: I know all about Ephraim; Israel is not hidden from me. Ephraim, you have now turned to prostitution; Israel is corrupt. 
#Os5-4: "Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. A spirit of prostitution is in their heart; they do not acknowledge the LORD. 
#Os5-5: Israel's arrogance testifies against them; the Israelites, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin; Judah also stumbles with them. 
#Os5-6: When they go with their flocks and herds to seek the LORD, they will not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them. 
#Os5-7: They are unfaithful to the LORD; they give birth to illegitimate children. When they celebrate their New Moon feasts, he will devour "their fields. 
#Os5-8: "Sound the trumpet in Gibeah, the horn in Ramah. Raise the battle cry in Beth Aven "; lead on, Benjamin. 
#Os5-9: Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of reckoning. Among the tribes of Israel I proclaim what is certain. 
#Os5-10: Judah's leaders are like those who move boundary stones. I will pour out my wrath on them like a flood of water. 
#Os5-11: Ephraim is oppressed, trampled in judgment, intent on pursuing idols. [^3] 
#Os5-12: I am like a moth to Ephraim, like rot to the people of Judah. 
#Os5-13: "When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sores, then Ephraim turned to Assyria, and sent to the great king for help. But he is not able to cure you, not able to heal your sores. 
#Os5-14: For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, like a great lion to Judah. I will tear them to pieces and go away; I will carry them off, with no one to rescue them. 
#Os5-15: Then I will return to my lair until they have borne their guilt and seek my face — in their misery they will earnestly seek me."
 OSÉIAS 6
#Os6-1: "Come, let us return to the LORD. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds. 
#Os6-2: After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence. 
#Os6-3: Let us acknowledge the LORD; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth." 
#Os6-4: "What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears. 
#Os6-5: Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth — then my judgments go forth like the sun. [^1] 
#Os6-6: For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings. 
#Os6-7: As at Adam, "they have broken the covenant; they were unfaithful to me there. 
#Os6-8: Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with footprints of blood. 
#Os6-9: As marauders lie in ambush for a victim, so do bands of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, carrying out their wicked schemes. 
#Os6-10: I have seen a horrible thing in Israel: There Ephraim is given to prostitution, Israel is defiled. 
#Os6-11: "Also for you, Judah, a harvest is appointed. "Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people,
 OSÉIAS 7
#Os7-1: whenever I would heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim are exposed and the crimes of Samaria revealed. They practice deceit, thieves break into houses, bandits rob in the streets; 
#Os7-2: but they do not realize that I remember all their evil deeds. Their sins engulf them; they are always before me. 
#Os7-3: "They delight the king with their wickedness, the princes with their lies. 
#Os7-4: They are all adulterers, burning like an oven whose fire the baker need not stir from the kneading of the dough till it rises. 
#Os7-5: On the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine, and he joins hands with the mockers. 
#Os7-6: Their hearts are like an oven; they approach him with intrigue. Their passion smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire. 
#Os7-7: All of them are hot as an oven; they devour their rulers. All their kings fall, and none of them calls on me. 
#Os7-8: "Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is a flat loaf not turned over. 
#Os7-9: Foreigners sap his strength, but he does not realize it. His hair is sprinkled with gray, but he does not notice. 
#Os7-10: Israel's arrogance testifies against him, but despite all this he does not return to the LORD his God or search for him. 
#Os7-11: "Ephraim is like a dove, easily deceived and senseless — now calling to Egypt, now turning to Assyria. 
#Os7-12: When they go, I will throw my net over them; I will pull them down like the birds in the sky. When I hear them flocking together, I will catch them. 
#Os7-13: Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! I long to redeem them but they speak about me falsely. 
#Os7-14: They do not cry out to me from their hearts but wail on their beds. They slash themselves, "appealing to their gods for grain and new wine, but they turn away from me. 
#Os7-15: I trained them and strengthened their arms, but they plot evil against me. 
#Os7-16: They do not turn to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent words. For this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.
 OSÉIAS 8
#Os8-1: "Put the trumpet to your lips! An eagle is over the house of the LORD because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law. 
#Os8-2: Israel cries out to me, 'Our God, we acknowledge you!' 
#Os8-3: But Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him. 
#Os8-4: They set up kings without my consent; they choose princes without my approval. With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction. 
#Os8-5: Samaria, throw out your calf-idol! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity? 
#Os8-6: They are from Israel! This calf —a metalworker has made it; it is not God. It will be broken in pieces, that calf of Samaria. 
#Os8-7: "They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head; it will produce no flour. Were it to yield grain, foreigners would swallow it up. 
#Os8-8: Israel is swallowed up; now she is among the nations like something no one wants. 
#Os8-9: For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to lovers. 
#Os8-10: Although they have sold themselves among the nations, I will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king. 
#Os8-11: "Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings, these have become altars for sinning. 
#Os8-12: I wrote for them the many things of my law, but they regarded them as something foreign.

#Os8-14: Israel has forgotten their Maker and built palaces; Judah has fortified many towns. But I will send fire on their cities that will consume their fortresses."
 OSÉIAS 9
#Os9-1: Do not rejoice, Israel; do not be jubilant like the other nations. For you have been unfaithful to your God; you love the wages of a prostitute at every threshing floor. 
#Os9-2: Threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people; the new wine will fail them. 
#Os9-3: They will not remain in the LORD's land; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria. 
#Os9-4: They will not pour out wine offerings to the LORD, nor will their sacrifices please him. Such sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat them will be unclean. This food will be for themselves; it will not come into the temple of the LORD. 
#Os9-5: What will you do on the day of your appointed festivals, on the feast days of the LORD? 
#Os9-6: Even if they escape from destruction, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. Their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers, and thorns will overrun their tents. 
#Os9-7: The days of punishment are coming, the days of reckoning are at hand. Let Israel know this. Because your sins are so many and your hostility so great, the prophet is considered a fool, the inspired person a maniac. 
#Os9-8: The prophet, along with my God, is the watchman over Ephraim, "yet snares await him on all his paths, and hostility in the house of his God. 
#Os9-9: They have sunk deep into corruption, as in the days of Gibeah. God will remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins. 
#Os9-10: "When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the desert; when I saw your ancestors, it was like seeing the early fruit on the fig tree. But when they came to Baal Peor, they consecrated themselves to that shameful idol and became as vile as the thing they loved. 
#Os9-11: Ephraim's glory will fly away like a bird — no birth, no pregnancy, no conception. 
#Os9-12: Even if they rear children, I will bereave them of every one. Woe to them when I turn away from them! 
#Os9-13: I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim will bring out their children to the slayer." 
#Os9-14: Give them, LORD — what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that are dry. 
#Os9-15: "Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal, I hated them there. Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious. 
#Os9-16: Ephraim is blighted, their root is withered, they yield no fruit. Even if they bear children, I will slay their cherished offspring." 
#Os9-17: My God will reject them because they have not obeyed him; they will be wanderers among the nations.
 OSÉIAS 10
#Os10-1: Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he built more altars; as his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones. 
#Os10-2: Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones. 
#Os10-3: Then they will say, "We have no king because we did not revere the LORD. But even if we had a king, what could he do for us?" 
#Os10-4: They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field. 
#Os10-5: The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven. "Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile. 
#Os10-6: It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances. 
#Os10-7: Samaria's king will be destroyed, swept away like a twig on the surface of the waters. 
#Os10-8: The high places of wickedness "will be destroyed — it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" and to the hills, "Fall on us!" 
#Os10-9: "Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel, and there you have remained. "Will not war again overtake the evildoers in Gibeah? 
#Os10-10: When I please, I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin. 
#Os10-11: Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will drive Ephraim, Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground. 
#Os10-12: Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers his righteousness on you. 
#Os10-13: But you have planted wickedness, you have reaped evil, you have eaten the fruit of deception. Because you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors, 
#Os10-14: the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be devastated — as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children. 
#Os10-15: So will it happen to you, Bethel, because your wickedness is great. When that day dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.
 OSÉIAS 11
#Os11-1: "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. 
#Os11-2: But the more they were called, the more they went away from me. "They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images. 
#Os11-3: It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them. 
#Os11-4: I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them. 
#Os11-5: "Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent? 
#Os11-6: A sword will flash in their cities; it will devour their false prophets and put an end to their plans. 
#Os11-7: My people are determined to turn from me. Even though they call me God Most High, I will by no means exalt them. 
#Os11-8: "How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused. 
#Os11-9: I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I devastate Ephraim again. For I am God, and not a man — the Holy One among you. I will not come against their cities. 
#Os11-10: They will follow the LORD; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west. 
#Os11-11: They will come from Egypt, trembling like sparrows, from Assyria, fluttering like doves. I will settle them in their homes," declares the LORD. 
#Os11-12: Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, Israel with deceit. And Judah is unruly against God, even against the faithful Holy One. [^2]
 OSÉIAS 12
#Os12-1: Ephraim feeds on the wind; he pursues the east wind all day and multiplies lies and violence. He makes a treaty with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt. 
#Os12-2: The LORD has a charge to bring against Judah; he will punish Jacob "according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds. 
#Os12-3: In the womb he grasped his brother's heel; as a man he struggled with God. 
#Os12-4: He struggled with the angel and overcame him; he wept and begged for his favor. He found him at Bethel and talked with him there — 
#Os12-5: the LORD God Almighty, the LORD is his name! 
#Os12-6: But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and wait for your God always. 
#Os12-7: The merchant uses dishonest scales and loves to defraud. 
#Os12-8: Ephraim boasts, "I am very rich; I have become wealthy. With all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin." 
#Os12-9: "I have been the LORD your God ever since you came out of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, as in the days of your appointed festivals. 
#Os12-10: I spoke to the prophets, gave them many visions and told parables through them." 
#Os12-11: Is Gilead wicked? Its people are worthless! Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Their altars will be like piles of stones on a plowed field. 
#Os12-12: Jacob fled to the country of Aram "; Israel served to get a wife, and to pay for her he tended sheep. 
#Os12-13: The LORD used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt, by a prophet he cared for him. 
#Os12-14: But Ephraim has aroused his bitter anger; his Lord will leave on him the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay him for his contempt.
 OSÉIAS 13
#Os13-1: When Ephraim spoke, people trembled; he was exalted in Israel. But he became guilty of Baal worship and died. 
#Os13-2: Now they sin more and more; they make idols for themselves from their silver, cleverly fashioned images, all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of these people, "They offer human sacrifices! They kiss "calf-idols!" 
#Os13-3: Therefore they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears, like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, like smoke escaping through a window. 
#Os13-4: "But I have been the LORD your God ever since you came out of Egypt. You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior except me. 
#Os13-5: I cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of burning heat. 
#Os13-6: When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot me. 
#Os13-7: So I will be like a lion to them, like a leopard I will lurk by the path. 
#Os13-8: Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and rip them open; like a lion I will devour them — a wild animal will tear them apart. 
#Os13-9: "You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me, against your helper. 
#Os13-10: Where is your king, that he may save you? Where are your rulers in all your towns, of whom you said, 'Give me a king and princes'? 
#Os13-11: So in my anger I gave you a king, and in my wrath I took him away. 
#Os13-12: The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record. 
#Os13-13: Pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him, but he is a child without wisdom; when the time arrives, he doesn't have the sense to come out of the womb. 
#Os13-14: "I will deliver this people from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death. Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O grave, is your destruction? "I will have no compassion, 
#Os13-15: even though he thrives among his brothers. An east wind from the LORD will come, blowing in from the desert; his spring will fail and his well dry up. His storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures. 
#Os13-16: The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open." [^2]
 OSÉIAS 14
#Os14-1: Return, Israel, to the LORD your God. Your sins have been your downfall! 
#Os14-2: Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to him: "Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips. [^2] 
#Os14-3: Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount warhorses. We will never again say 'Our gods' to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion." 
#Os14-4: "I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them. 
#Os14-5: I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots; 
#Os14-6: his young shoots will grow. His splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon. 
#Os14-7: People will dwell again in his shade; they will flourish like the grain, they will blossom like the vine — Israel's fame will be like the wine of Lebanon. 
#Os14-8: Ephraim, what more have I "to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a flourishing juniper; your fruitfulness comes from me." 
#Os14-9: Who is wise? Let them realize these things. Who is discerning? Let them understand. The ways of the LORD are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.

#Jl2-1: Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming. It is close at hand —

#Jl2-17: Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the portico and the altar. Let them say, "Spare your people, LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"

#Jl3-19: But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood. 
#Jl3-20: Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations. 
#Jl3-21: Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not." The LORD dwells in Zion!

#Am3-6: When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it? 
#Am3-7: Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets. 
#Am3-8: The lion has roared — who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken — who can but prophesy? 
#Am3-9: Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt: "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people." 
#Am3-10: "They do not know how to do right," declares the LORD, "who store up in their fortresses what they have plundered and looted." 
#Am3-11: Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "An enemy will overrun your land, pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses." 
#Am3-12: This is what the LORD says: "As a shepherd rescues from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued, with only the head of a bed and a piece of fabric "from a couch. "" 
#Am3-13: "Hear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob," declares the Lord, the LORD God Almighty. 
#Am3-14: "On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground. 
#Am3-15: I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed and the mansions will be demolished," declares the LORD.

#Am4-1: Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands, "Bring us some drinks!" 
#Am4-2: The Sovereign LORD has sworn by his holiness: "The time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks. [^1] 
#Am4-3: You will each go straight out through breaches in the wall, and you will be cast out toward Harmon, "" declares the LORD.

#Am4-5: Burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings — boast about them, you Israelites, for this is what you love to do," declares the Sovereign LORD. 
#Am4-6: "I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD. 
#Am4-7: "I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and dried up. 
#Am4-8: People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD. 
#Am4-9: "Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, destroying them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD. 
#Am4-10: "I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD. 
#Am4-11: "I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD. 
#Am4-12: "Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God." 
#Am4-13: He who forms the mountains, who creates the wind, and who reveals his thoughts to mankind, who turns dawn to darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth — the LORD God Almighty is his name.

#Am5-1: Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you: 
#Am5-2: "Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise again, deserted in her own land, with no one to lift her up." 
#Am5-3: This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Israel: "Your city that marches out a thousand strong will have only a hundred left; your town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left." 
#Am5-4: This is what the LORD says to Israel: "Seek me and live; 
#Am5-5: do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, do not journey to Beersheba. For Gilgal will surely go into exile, and Bethel will be reduced to nothing. "" 
#Am5-6: Seek the LORD and live, or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire; it will devour them, and Bethel will have no one to quench it. 
#Am5-7: There are those who turn justice into bitterness and cast righteousness to the ground. 
#Am5-8: He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns midnight into dawn and darkens day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land — the LORD is his name. 
#Am5-9: With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold and brings the fortified city to ruin. 
#Am5-10: There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court and detest the one who tells the truth. 
#Am5-11: You levy a straw tax on the poor and impose a tax on their grain. Therefore, though you have built stone mansions, you will not live in them; though you have planted lush vineyards, you will not drink their wine. 
#Am5-12: For I know how many are your offenses and how great your sins. There are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes and deprive the poor of justice in the courts. 
#Am5-13: Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times, for the times are evil. 
#Am5-14: Seek good, not evil, that you may live. Then the LORD God Almighty will be with you, just as you say he is. 
#Am5-15: Hate evil, love good; maintain justice in the courts. Perhaps the LORD God Almighty will have mercy on the remnant of Joseph. 
#Am5-16: Therefore this is what the Lord, the LORD God Almighty, says: "There will be wailing in all the streets and cries of anguish in every public square. The farmers will be summoned to weep and the mourners to wail. 
#Am5-17: There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass through your midst," says the LORD. 
#Am5-18: Woe to you who long for the day of the LORD! Why do you long for the day of the LORD? That day will be darkness, not light. 
#Am5-19: It will be as though a man fled from a lion only to meet a bear, as though he entered his house and rested his hand on the wall only to have a snake bite him. 
#Am5-20: Will not the day of the LORD be darkness, not light — pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness? 
#Am5-21: "I hate, I despise your religious festivals; your assemblies are a stench to me. 
#Am5-22: Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Though you bring choice fellowship offerings, I will have no regard for them. 
#Am5-23: Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps. 
#Am5-24: But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!

#Am6-2: Go to Kalneh and look at it; go from there to great Hamath, and then go down to Gath in Philistia. Are they better off than your two kingdoms? Is their land larger than yours? 
#Am6-3: You put off the day of disaster and bring near a reign of terror. 
#Am6-4: You lie on beds adorned with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves. 
#Am6-5: You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments. 
#Am6-6: You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.

#Am6-9: If ten people are left in one house, they too will die. 
#Am6-10: And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them "asks anyone who might be hiding there, "Is anyone else with you?" and he says, "No," then he will go on to say, "Hush! We must not mention the name of the LORD." 
#Am6-11: For the LORD has given the command, and he will smash the great house into pieces and the small house into bits. 
#Am6-12: Do horses run on the rocky crags? Does one plow the sea "with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness — 
#Am6-13: you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar "and say, "Did we not take Karnaim "by our own strength?" 
#Am6-14: For the LORD God Almighty declares, "I will stir up a nation against you, Israel, that will oppress you all the way from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah."

#Am7-1: This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king's share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming up. 
#Am7-2: When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, "Sovereign LORD, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!" 
#Am7-3: So the LORD relented. "This will not happen," the LORD said. 
#Am7-4: This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: The Sovereign LORD was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land. 
#Am7-5: Then I cried out, "Sovereign LORD, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!" 
#Am7-6: So the LORD relented. "This will not happen either," the Sovereign LORD said. 
#Am7-7: This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, "with a plumb line "in his hand. 
#Am7-8: And the LORD asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" "A plumb line," I replied. Then the Lord said, "Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. 
#Am7-9: "The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam." 
#Am7-10: Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: "Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words. 
#Am7-11: For this is what Amos is saying: "'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'" 
#Am7-12: Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. 
#Am7-13: Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king's sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom." 
#Am7-14: Amos answered Amaziah, "I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. 
#Am7-15: But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.' 
#Am7-16: Now then, hear the word of the LORD. You say, "'Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.' 
#Am7-17: "Therefore this is what the LORD says: "'Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in a pagan "country. And Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'"

#Am8-3: "In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. "Many, many bodies —flung everywhere! Silence!" 
#Am8-4: Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land, 
#Am8-5: saying, "When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?" — skimping on the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales, 
#Am8-6: buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat. 
#Am8-7: The LORD has sworn by himself, the Pride of Jacob: "I will never forget anything they have done. 
#Am8-8: "Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt. 
#Am8-9: "In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight. 
#Am8-10: I will turn your religious festivals into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day. 
#Am8-11: "The days are coming," declares the Sovereign LORD, "when I will send a famine through the land — not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.

#Ob1-3: The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks "and make your home on the heights, you who say to yourself, 'Who can bring me down to the ground?'

JONAS
 JONAS 1
#Jn1-1: The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai: 
#Jn1-2: "Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me." 
#Jn1-3: But Jonah ran away from the LORD and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD. 
#Jn1-4: Then the LORD sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up. 
#Jn1-5: All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep. 
#Jn1-6: The captain went to him and said, "How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish." 
#Jn1-7: Then the sailors said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity." They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah. 
#Jn1-8: So they asked him, "Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What kind of work do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?" 
#Jn1-9: He answered, "I am a Hebrew and I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land." 
#Jn1-10: This terrified them and they asked, "What have you done?" (They knew he was running away from the LORD, because he had already told them so.) 
#Jn1-11: The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?" 
#Jn1-12: "Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied, "and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you." 
#Jn1-13: Instead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before. 
#Jn1-14: Then they cried out to the LORD, "Please, LORD, do not let us die for taking this man's life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, LORD, have done as you pleased." 
#Jn1-15: Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm. 
#Jn1-16: At this the men greatly feared the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows to him. 
#Jn1-17: Now the LORD provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
 JONAS 2
#Jn2-1: From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God. 
#Jn2-2: He said: "In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened to my cry. 
#Jn2-3: You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me. 
#Jn2-4: I said, 'I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.' 
#Jn2-5: The engulfing waters threatened me, "the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. 
#Jn2-6: To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you, LORD my God, brought my life up from the pit. 
#Jn2-7: "When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple. 
#Jn2-8: "Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God's love for them. 
#Jn2-9: But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. I will say, 'Salvation comes from the LORD.'" 
#Jn2-10: And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
 JONAS 3
#Jn3-1: Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time: 
#Jn3-2: "Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you." 
#Jn3-3: Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very important city-a visit required three days. 
#Jn3-4: On the first day, Jonah started into the city. He proclaimed: "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned." 
#Jn3-5: The Ninevites believed God. They declared a fast, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth. 
#Jn3-6: When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust. 
#Jn3-7: Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let any man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. 
#Jn3-8: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. 
#Jn3-9: Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish." 
#Jn3-10: When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.
 JONAS 4
#Jn4-1: But to Jonah this seemed very wrong, and he became angry. 
#Jn4-2: He prayed to the LORD, "Isn't this what I said, LORD, when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity. 
#Jn4-3: Now, LORD, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live." 
#Jn4-4: But the LORD replied, "Is it right for you to be angry?" 
#Jn4-5: Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city. 
#Jn4-6: Then the LORD God provided a leafy plant "and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant. 
#Jn4-7: But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered. 
#Jn4-8: When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, "It would be better for me to die than to live." 
#Jn4-9: But God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?" "It is," he said. "And I'm so angry I wish I were dead." 
#Jn4-10: But the LORD said, "You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight. 
#Jn4-11: And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left —and also many animals?"

#Mq1-2: Hear, you peoples, all of you, listen, earth and all who live in it, that the Sovereign LORD may bear witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. 
#Mq1-3: Look! The LORD is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth. 
#Mq1-4: The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope. 
#Mq1-5: All this is because of Jacob's transgression, because of the sins of the people of Israel. What is Jacob's transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah's high place? Is it not Jerusalem? 
#Mq1-6: "Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations. 
#Mq1-7: All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used." 
#Mq1-8: Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl. 
#Mq1-9: For Samaria's plague is incurable; it has spread to Judah. It has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself. 
#Mq1-10: Tell it not in Gath "; weep not at all. In Beth Ophrah "roll in the dust. 
#Mq1-11: Pass by naked and in shame, you who live in Shaphir. "Those who live in Zaanan "will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning; it no longer protects you. 
#Mq1-12: Those who live in Maroth "writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem. 
#Mq1-13: You who live in Lachish, harness fast horses to the chariot. You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you. 
#Mq1-14: Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Akzib "will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel. 
#Mq1-15: I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. "The nobles of Israel will flee to Adullam. 
#Mq1-16: Shave your head in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourself as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile.

#Mq2-1: Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning's light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it. 
#Mq2-2: They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud people of their homes, they rob them of their inheritance. 
#Mq2-3: Therefore, the LORD says: "I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity. 
#Mq2-4: In that day people will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: 'We are utterly ruined; my people's possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.'" 
#Mq2-5: Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot. 
#Mq2-6: "Do not prophesy," their prophets say. "Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us." 
#Mq2-7: You descendants of Jacob, should it be said, "Does the LORD become "impatient? Does he do such things?" "Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright? 
#Mq2-8: Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle. 
#Mq2-9: You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever. 
#Mq2-10: Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy. 
#Mq2-11: If a liar and deceiver comes and says, 'I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' that would be just the prophet for this people! 
#Mq2-12: "I will surely gather all of you, Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people. 
#Mq2-13: The One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their King will pass through before them, the LORD at their head."
 MIQUÉIAS 3
#Mq3-1: Then I said, "Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel. Should you not embrace justice, 
#Mq3-2: you who hate good and love evil; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones; 
#Mq3-3: who eat my people's flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?" 
#Mq3-4: Then they will cry out to the LORD, but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done. 
#Mq3-5: This is what the LORD says: "As for the prophets who lead my people astray, they proclaim 'peace' if they have something to eat, but prepare to wage war against anyone who refuses to feed them. 
#Mq3-6: Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination. The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them. 
#Mq3-7: The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God." 
#Mq3-8: But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin. 
#Mq3-9: Hear this, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right; 
#Mq3-10: who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness. 
#Mq3-11: Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they look for the LORD's support and say, "Is not the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us." 
#Mq3-12: Therefore because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.
 MIQUÉIAS 4
#Mq4-1: In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. 
#Mq4-2: Many nations will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
#Mq4-3: He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. 
#Mq4-4: Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD Almighty has spoken. 
#Mq4-5: All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. 
#Mq4-6: "In that day," declares the LORD, "I will gather the lame; I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief. 
#Mq4-7: I will make the lame my remnant, those driven away a strong nation. The LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever. 
#Mq4-8: As for you, watchtower of the flock, stronghold "of Daughter Zion, the former dominion will be restored to you; kingship will come to Daughter Jerusalem." 
#Mq4-9: Why do you now cry aloud — have you no king "? Has your ruler "perished, that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor? 
#Mq4-10: Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There the LORD will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies. 
#Mq4-11: But now many nations are gathered against you. They say, "Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!" 
#Mq4-12: But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor. 
#Mq4-13: "Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will give you horns of iron; I will give you hooves of bronze, and you will break to pieces many nations." You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
 MIQUÉIAS 5
#Mq5-1: Marshal your troops now, city of troops, for a siege is laid against us. They will strike Israel's ruler on the cheek with a rod.

#Mq5-3: Therefore Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor bears a son, and the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites. 
#Mq5-4: He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they will live securely, for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth. 
#Mq5-5: And he will be our peace when the Assyrians invade our land and march through our fortresses. We will raise against them seven shepherds, even eight commanders, 
#Mq5-6: who will rule "the land of Assyria with the sword, the land of Nimrod with drawn sword. "He will deliver us from the Assyrians when they invade our land and march across our borders. 
#Mq5-7: The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or depend on man. 
#Mq5-8: The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which mauls and mangles as it goes, and no one can rescue. 
#Mq5-9: Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies, and all your foes will be destroyed. 
#Mq5-10: "In that day," declares the LORD, "I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots. 
#Mq5-11: I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds. 
#Mq5-12: I will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells. 
#Mq5-13: I will destroy your idols and your sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands. 
#Mq5-14: I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles "when I demolish your cities. 
#Mq5-15: I will take vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations that have not obeyed me."
 MIQUÉIAS 6
#Mq6-1: Listen to what the LORD says: "Stand up, plead my case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say. 
#Mq6-2: "Hear, you mountains, the LORD's accusation; listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the LORD has a case against his people; he is lodging a charge against Israel. 
#Mq6-3: "My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me. 
#Mq6-4: I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam. 
#Mq6-5: My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD." 
#Mq6-6: With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? 
#Mq6-7: Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
#Mq6-8: He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly "with your God. 
#Mq6-9: Listen! The LORD is calling to the city — and to fear your name is wisdom — "Heed the rod and the One who appointed it. [^2] 
#Mq6-10: Am I still to forget your ill-gotten treasures, you wicked house, and the short ephah, "which is accursed? 
#Mq6-11: Shall I acquit someone with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights? 
#Mq6-12: Your rich people are violent; your inhabitants are liars and their tongues speak deceitfully. 
#Mq6-13: Therefore, I have begun to destroy you, to ruin "you because of your sins. 
#Mq6-14: You will eat but not be satisfied; your stomach will still be empty. "You will store up but save nothing, because what you save "I will give to the sword. 
#Mq6-15: You will plant but not harvest; you will press olives but not use the oil, you will crush grapes but not drink the wine. 
#Mq6-16: You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab's house; you have followed their traditions. Therefore I will give you over to ruin and your people to derision; you will bear the scorn of the nations. ""
 MIQUÉIAS 7
#Mq7-1: What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave. 
#Mq7-2: The faithful have been swept from the land; not one upright person remains. Everyone lies in wait to shed blood; they hunt each other with nets. 
#Mq7-3: Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire — they all conspire together. 
#Mq7-4: The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day God visits you has come, the day your watchmen sound the alarm. Now is the time of your confusion. 
#Mq7-5: Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with the woman who lies in your embrace guard the words of your lips. 
#Mq7-6: For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law — a man's enemies are the members of his own household. 
#Mq7-7: But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me. 
#Mq7-8: Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light. 
#Mq7-9: Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD's wrath, until he pleads my case and upholds my cause. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness. 
#Mq7-10: Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets. 
#Mq7-11: The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries. 
#Mq7-12: In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain. 
#Mq7-13: The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds. 
#Mq7-14: Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands. "Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago. 
#Mq7-15: "As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them my wonders." 
#Mq7-16: Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths and their ears will become deaf. 
#Mq7-17: They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD our God and will be afraid of you. 
#Mq7-18: Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. 
#Mq7-19: You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea. 
#Mq7-20: You will be faithful to Jacob, and show love to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our ancestors in days long ago.

#Na2-2: The LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines.

#Na2-4: The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning.

#Na3-3: Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears! Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number, people stumbling over the corpses — 
#Na3-4: all because of the wanton lust of a prostitute, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft. 
#Na3-5: "I am against you," declares the LORD Almighty. "I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame.

#Na3-7: All who see you will flee from you and say, 'Nineveh is in ruins —who will mourn for her?' Where can I find anyone to comfort you?"

#Na3-9: Cush "and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were among her allies.

#Hc1-1: The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received. 
#Hc1-2: How long, LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, "Violence!" but you do not save? 
#Hc1-3: Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds. 
#Hc1-4: Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted. 
#Hc1-5: "Look at the nations and watch — and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told. 
#Hc1-6: I am raising up the Babylonians, "that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own. 
#Hc1-7: They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor. 
#Hc1-8: Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like an eagle swooping to devour; 
#Hc1-9: they all come intent on violence. Their hordes "advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand. 
#Hc1-10: They mock kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; by building earthen ramps they capture them. 
#Hc1-11: Then they sweep past like the wind and go on — guilty people, whose own strength is their god." 
#Hc1-12: LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, you "will never die. You, LORD, have appointed them to execute judgment; you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish. 
#Hc1-13: Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves? 
#Hc1-14: You have made people like the fish in the sea, like the sea creatures that have no ruler. 
#Hc1-15: The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad. 
#Hc1-16: Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food. 
#Hc1-17: Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy?

#Hc2-3: For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it "will certainly come and will not delay. 
#Hc2-4: "See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright — but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness "— 
#Hc2-5: indeed, wine betrays him; he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples. 
#Hc2-6: "Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, "'Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?' 
#Hc2-7: Will not your creditors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their prey. 
#Hc2-8: Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed human blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. 
#Hc2-9: "Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain, setting his nest on high to escape the clutches of ruin! 
#Hc2-10: You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, shaming your own house and forfeiting your life. 
#Hc2-11: The stones of the wall will cry out, and the beams of the woodwork will echo it. 
#Hc2-12: "Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by injustice! 
#Hc2-13: Has not the LORD Almighty determined that the people's labor is only fuel for the fire, that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing? 
#Hc2-14: For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea. 
#Hc2-15: "Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, so that he can gaze on their naked bodies! 
#Hc2-16: You will be filled with shame instead of glory. Now it is your turn! Drink and let your nakedness be exposed "! The cup from the LORD's right hand is coming around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory. 
#Hc2-17: The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your destruction of animals will terrify you. For you have shed human blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. 
#Hc2-18: "Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak. 
#Hc2-19: Woe to him who says to wood, 'Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, 'Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it."

#Hc3-2: LORD, I have heard of your fame; I stand in awe of your deeds, LORD. Repeat them in our day, in our time make them known; in wrath remember mercy. 
#Hc3-3: God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. "His glory covered the heavens and his praise filled the earth. 
#Hc3-4: His splendor was like the sunrise; rays flashed from his hand, where his power was hidden. 
#Hc3-5: Plague went before him; pestilence followed his steps. 
#Hc3-6: He stood, and shook the earth; he looked, and made the nations tremble. The ancient mountains crumbled and the age-old hills collapsed — but he marches on forever. 
#Hc3-7: I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, the dwellings of Midian in anguish. 
#Hc3-8: Were you angry with the rivers, LORD? Was your wrath against the streams? Did you rage against the sea when you rode your horses and your chariots to victory? 
#Hc3-9: You uncovered your bow, you called for many arrows. You split the earth with rivers; 
#Hc3-10: the mountains saw you and writhed. Torrents of water swept by; the deep roared and lifted its waves on high. 
#Hc3-11: Sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of your flashing spear. 
#Hc3-12: In wrath you strode through the earth and in anger you threshed the nations. 
#Hc3-13: You came out to deliver your people, to save your anointed one. You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness, you stripped him from head to foot. 
#Hc3-14: With his own spear you pierced his head when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as though about to devour the wretched who were in hiding. 
#Hc3-15: You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters. 
#Hc3-16: I heard and my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound; decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled. Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us. 
#Hc3-17: Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, 
#Hc3-18: yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior. 
#Hc3-19: The Sovereign LORD is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to tread on the heights. For the director of music. On my stringed instruments.

#Sf1-3: "I will sweep away both man and beast; I will sweep away the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea — and the idols that cause the wicked to stumble." ""When I destroy all mankind on the face of the earth," declares the LORD,

#Sf1-6: those who turn back from following the LORD and neither seek the LORD nor inquire of him."

#Sf1-9: On that day I will punish all who avoid stepping on the threshold, "who fill the temple of their gods with violence and deceit. 
#Sf1-10: "On that day," declares the LORD, "a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing from the New Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills. 
#Sf1-11: Wail, you who live in the market district "; all your merchants will be wiped out, all who trade with "silver will be destroyed. 
#Sf1-12: At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, who are like wine left on its dregs, who think, 'The LORD will do nothing, either good or bad.' 
#Sf1-13: Their wealth will be plundered, their houses demolished. Though they build houses, they will not live in them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink the wine." 
#Sf1-14: The great day of the LORD is near — near and coming quickly. The cry on the day of the LORD is bitter; the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry. 
#Sf1-15: That day will be a day of wrath — a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness — 
#Sf1-16: a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers. 
#Sf1-17: "I will bring such distress on all people that they will grope about like those who are blind, because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their entrails like dung. 
#Sf1-18: Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD's wrath." In the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be consumed, for he will make a sudden end of all who live on the earth.
 SOFONIAS 2
#Sf2-1: Gather together, gather yourselves together, you shameful nation, 
#Sf2-2: before the decree takes effect and that day passes like windblown chaff, before the LORD's fierce anger comes upon you, before the day of the LORD's wrath comes upon you. 
#Sf2-3: Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the LORD's anger. 
#Sf2-4: Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be emptied and Ekron uprooted. 
#Sf2-5: Woe to you who live by the sea, you Kerethite people; the word of the LORD is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. He says, "I will destroy you, and none will be left." 
#Sf2-6: The land by the sea will become pastures having wells for shepherds and pens for flocks. 
#Sf2-7: That land will belong to the remnant of the people of Judah; there they will find pasture. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon. The LORD their God will care for them; he will restore their fortunes. [^1] 
#Sf2-8: "I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites, who insulted my people and made threats against their land. 
#Sf2-9: Therefore, as surely as I live," declares the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, "surely Moab will become like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah — a place of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will inherit their land." 
#Sf2-10: This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the LORD Almighty. 
#Sf2-11: The LORD will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the earth. Distant nations will bow down to him, all of them in their own lands. 
#Sf2-12: "You Cushites, "too, will be slain by my sword." 
#Sf2-13: He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert. 
#Sf2-14: Flocks and herds will lie down there, creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their hooting will echo through the windows, rubble will fill the doorways, the beams of cedar will be exposed. 
#Sf2-15: This is the city of revelry that lived in safety. She said to herself, "I am the one! And there is none besides me." What a ruin she has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists.
 SOFONIAS 3
#Sf3-1: Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled! 
#Sf3-2: She obeys no one, she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the LORD, she does not draw near to her God. 
#Sf3-3: Her officials within her are roaring lions; her rulers are evening wolves, who leave nothing for the morning. 
#Sf3-4: Her prophets are unprincipled; they are treacherous people. Her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law. 
#Sf3-5: The LORD within her is righteous; he does no wrong. Morning by morning he dispenses his justice, and every new day he does not fail, yet the unrighteous know no shame. 
#Sf3-6: "I have destroyed nations; their strongholds are demolished. I have left their streets deserted, with no one passing through. Their cities are laid waste; they are deserted and empty. 
#Sf3-7: Of Jerusalem I thought, 'Surely you will fear me and accept correction!' Then her place of refuge "would not be destroyed, nor all my punishments come upon "her. But they were still eager to act corruptly in all they did. 
#Sf3-8: Therefore wait for me," declares the LORD, "for the day I will stand up to testify. "I have decided to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms and to pour out my wrath on them — all my fierce anger. The whole world will be consumed by the fire of my jealous anger. 
#Sf3-9: "Then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him shoulder to shoulder. 
#Sf3-10: From beyond the rivers of Cush "my worshipers, my scattered people, will bring me offerings. 
#Sf3-11: On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done to me, because I will remove from you your arrogant boasters. Never again will you be haughty on my holy hill. 
#Sf3-12: But I will leave within you the meek and humble. The remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the LORD. 
#Sf3-13: They will do no wrong; they will tell no lies. A deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down and no one will make them afraid." 
#Sf3-14: Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem! 
#Sf3-15: The LORD has taken away your punishment, he has turned back your enemy. The LORD, the King of Israel, is with you; never again will you fear any harm. 
#Sf3-16: On that day they will say to Jerusalem, "Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp. 
#Sf3-17: The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing." 
#Sf3-18: "I will remove from you all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, which is a burden and reproach for you. 
#Sf3-19: At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame. 
#Sf3-20: At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes "before your very eyes," says the LORD.

#Ag1-1: In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua "son of Jozadak, "the high priest: 
#Ag1-2: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "These people say, 'The time has not yet come to rebuild the LORD's house.'" 
#Ag1-3: Then the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai: 
#Ag1-4: "Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?" 
#Ag1-5: Now this is what the LORD Almighty says: "Give careful thought to your ways. 
#Ag1-6: You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it." 
#Ag1-7: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Give careful thought to your ways. 
#Ag1-8: Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored," says the LORD. 
#Ag1-9: "You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?" declares the LORD Almighty. "Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house. 
#Ag1-10: Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops. 
#Ag1-11: I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands." 
#Ag1-12: Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the LORD their God had sent him. And the people feared the LORD. 
#Ag1-13: Then Haggai, the LORD's messenger, gave this message of the LORD to the people: "I am with you," declares the LORD. 
#Ag1-14: So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the LORD Almighty, their God, 
#Ag1-15: on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. In the second year of King Darius,
 AGEU 2
#Ag2-1: on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai: 
#Ag2-2: "Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jozadak, "the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them, 
#Ag2-3: 'Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing? 
#Ag2-4: But now be strong, Zerubbabel,' declares the LORD. 'Be strong, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,' declares the LORD, 'and work. For I am with you,' declares the LORD Almighty. 
#Ag2-5: 'This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.' 
#Ag2-6: "This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. 
#Ag2-7: I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ag2-8: 'The silver is mine and the gold is mine,' declares the LORD Almighty. 
#Ag2-9: 'The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,' says the LORD Almighty. 'And in this place I will grant peace,' declares the LORD Almighty." 
#Ag2-10: On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Haggai: 
#Ag2-11: "This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Ask the priests what the law says: 
#Ag2-12: If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food, does it become consecrated?'" The priests answered, "No." 
#Ag2-13: Then Haggai said, "If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?" "Yes," the priests replied, "it becomes defiled." 
#Ag2-14: Then Haggai said, "'So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,' declares the LORD. 'Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled. 
#Ag2-15: "'Now give careful thought to this from this day on "—consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the LORD's temple. 
#Ag2-16: When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty. 
#Ag2-17: I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not return to me,' declares the LORD. 
#Ag2-18: 'From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid. Give careful thought: 
#Ag2-19: Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit. "'From this day on I will bless you.'" 
#Ag2-20: The word of the LORD came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month: 
#Ag2-21: "Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. 
#Ag2-22: I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother. 
#Ag2-23: "'On that day,' declares the LORD Almighty, 'I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,' declares the LORD, 'and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,' declares the LORD Almighty."

 ZACARIAS 1
#Zc1-1: In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo: 
#Zc1-2: "The LORD was very angry with your ancestors. 
#Zc1-3: Therefore tell the people: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Return to me,' declares the LORD Almighty, 'and I will return to you,' says the LORD Almighty. 
#Zc1-4: Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.' But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the LORD. 
#Zc1-5: Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
#Zc1-6: But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors? "Then they repented and said, 'The LORD Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.'" 
#Zc1-7: On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo. 
#Zc1-8: During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses. 
#Zc1-9: I asked, "What are these, my lord?" The angel who was talking with me answered, "I will show you what they are." 
#Zc1-10: Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, "They are the ones the LORD has sent to go throughout the earth." 
#Zc1-11: And they reported to the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, "We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace." 
#Zc1-12: Then the angel of the LORD said, "LORD Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?" 
#Zc1-13: So the LORD spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me. 
#Zc1-14: Then the angel who was speaking to me said, "Proclaim this word: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, 
#Zc1-15: and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.' 
#Zc1-16: "Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,' declares the LORD Almighty. 
#Zc1-17: "Proclaim further: This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.'" 
#Zc1-18: Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns. 
#Zc1-19: I asked the angel who was speaking to me, "What are these?" He answered me, "These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem." 
#Zc1-20: Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. 
#Zc1-21: I asked, "What are these coming to do?" He answered, "These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people." [^1]
 ZACARIAS 2
#Zc2-1: Then I looked up, and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
#Zc2-2: I asked, "Where are you going?" He answered me, "To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is." 
#Zc2-3: While the angel who was speaking to me was leaving, another angel came to meet him 
#Zc2-4: and said to him: "Run, tell that young man, 'Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it. 
#Zc2-5: And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,' declares the LORD, 'and I will be its glory within.' 
#Zc2-6: "Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven," declares the LORD. 
#Zc2-7: "Come, Zion! Escape, you who live in Daughter Babylon!" 
#Zc2-8: For this is what the LORD Almighty says: "After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you —for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye — 
#Zc2-9: I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. "Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me. 
#Zc2-10: "Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you," declares the LORD. 
#Zc2-11: "Many nations will be joined with the LORD in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you. 
#Zc2-12: The LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem. 
#Zc2-13: Be still before the LORD, all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling."
 ZACARIAS 3
#Zc3-1: Then he showed me Joshua "the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan "standing at his right side to accuse him. 
#Zc3-2: The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?" 
#Zc3-3: Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 
#Zc3-4: The angel said to those who were standing before him, "Take off his filthy clothes." Then he said to Joshua, "See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you." 
#Zc3-5: Then I said, "Put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the LORD stood by. 
#Zc3-6: The angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua: 
#Zc3-7: "This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here. 
#Zc3-8: "'Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. 
#Zc3-9: See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes "on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,' says the LORD Almighty, 'and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day. 
#Zc3-10: "'In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,' declares the LORD Almighty."
 ZACARIAS 4
#Zc4-1: Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep. 
#Zc4-2: He asked me, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps. 
#Zc4-3: Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left." 
#Zc4-4: I asked the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?" 
#Zc4-5: He answered, "Do you not know what these are?" "No, my lord," I replied. 
#Zc4-6: So he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD Almighty. 
#Zc4-7: "What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of 'God bless it! God bless it!'" 
#Zc4-8: Then the word of the LORD came to me: 
#Zc4-9: "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you. 
#Zc4-10: "Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the LORD that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone "in the hand of Zerubbabel?" 
#Zc4-11: Then I asked the angel, "What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?" 
#Zc4-12: Again I asked him, "What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?" 
#Zc4-13: He replied, "Do you not know what these are?" "No, my lord," I said. 
#Zc4-14: So he said, "These are the two who are anointed to "serve the Lord of all the earth."
 ZACARIAS 5
#Zc5-1: I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll. 
#Zc5-2: He asked me, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. "" 
#Zc5-3: And he said to me, "This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished. 
#Zc5-4: The LORD Almighty declares, 'I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.'" 
#Zc5-5: Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, "Look up and see what is appearing." 
#Zc5-6: I asked, "What is it?" He replied, "It is a basket." And he added, "This is the iniquity "of the people throughout the land." 
#Zc5-7: Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman! 
#Zc5-8: He said, "This is wickedness," and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it. 
#Zc5-9: Then I looked up —and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth. 
#Zc5-10: "Where are they taking the basket?" I asked the angel who was speaking to me. 
#Zc5-11: He replied, "To the country of Babylonia "to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there in its place."
 ZACARIAS 6
#Zc6-1: I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains —mountains of bronze. 
#Zc6-2: The first chariot had red horses, the second black, 
#Zc6-3: the third white, and the fourth dappled —all of them powerful. 
#Zc6-4: I asked the angel who was speaking to me, "What are these, my lord?" 
#Zc6-5: The angel answered me, "These are the four spirits "of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world. 
#Zc6-6: The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west, "and the one with the dappled horses toward the south." 
#Zc6-7: When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, "Go throughout the earth!" So they went throughout the earth. 
#Zc6-8: Then he called to me, "Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit "rest in the land of the north." 
#Zc6-9: The word of the LORD came to me: 
#Zc6-10: "Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. 
#Zc6-11: Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak. [^4] 
#Zc6-12: Tell him this is what the LORD Almighty says: 'Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the LORD. 
#Zc6-13: It is he who will build the temple of the LORD, and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he "will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.' 
#Zc6-14: The crown will be given to Heldai, "Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen "son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 
#Zc6-15: Those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the LORD, and you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the LORD your God."
 ZACARIAS 7
#Zc7-1: In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev. 
#Zc7-2: The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, together with their men, to entreat the LORD 
#Zc7-3: by asking the priests of the house of the LORD Almighty and the prophets, "Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?" 
#Zc7-4: Then the word of the LORD Almighty came to me: 
#Zc7-5: "Ask all the people of the land and the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted? 
#Zc7-6: And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves? 
#Zc7-7: Are these not the words the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were settled?'" 
#Zc7-8: And the word of the LORD came again to Zechariah: 
#Zc7-9: "This is what the LORD Almighty said: 'Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. 
#Zc7-10: Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.' 
#Zc7-11: "But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears. 
#Zc7-12: They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the LORD Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the LORD Almighty was very angry. 
#Zc7-13: "'When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,' says the LORD Almighty. 
#Zc7-14: 'I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.'"
 ZACARIAS 8
#Zc8-1: The word of the LORD Almighty came to me. 
#Zc8-2: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her." 
#Zc8-3: This is what the LORD says: "I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the LORD Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain." 
#Zc8-4: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age. 
#Zc8-5: The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there." 
#Zc8-6: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?" declares the LORD Almighty. 
#Zc8-7: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west. 
#Zc8-8: I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God." 
#Zc8-9: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Now hear these words, 'Let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.' This is also what the prophets said who were present when the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD Almighty. 
#Zc8-10: Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor. 
#Zc8-11: But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past," declares the LORD Almighty. 
#Zc8-12: "The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people. 
#Zc8-13: Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse "among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. "Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong." 
#Zc8-14: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Just as I had determined to bring disaster on you and showed no pity when your ancestors angered me," says the LORD Almighty, 
#Zc8-15: "so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid. 
#Zc8-16: These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts; 
#Zc8-17: do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this," declares the LORD. 
#Zc8-18: The word of the LORD Almighty came to me. 
#Zc8-19: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah. Therefore love truth and peace." 
#Zc8-20: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come, 
#Zc8-21: and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say, 'Let us go at once to entreat the LORD and seek the LORD Almighty. I myself am going.' 
#Zc8-22: And many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the LORD Almighty and to entreat him." 
#Zc8-23: This is what the LORD Almighty says: "In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, 'Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.'"
 ZACARIAS 9
#Zc9-1: A prophecy: The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrak and will come to rest on Damascus — for the eyes of all people and all the tribes of Israel are on the LORD — [^1] 
#Zc9-2: and on Hamath too, which borders on it, and on Tyre and Sidon, though they are very skillful. 
#Zc9-3: Tyre has built herself a stronghold; she has heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets. 
#Zc9-4: But the Lord will take away her possessions and destroy her power on the sea, and she will be consumed by fire. 
#Zc9-5: Ashkelon will see it and fear; Gaza will writhe in agony, and Ekron too, for her hope will wither. Gaza will lose her king and Ashkelon will be deserted. 
#Zc9-6: A mongrel people will occupy Ashdod, and I will put an end to the pride of the Philistines. 
#Zc9-7: I will take the blood from their mouths, the forbidden food from between their teeth. Those who are left will belong to our God and become a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites. 
#Zc9-8: But I will encamp at my temple to guard it against marauding forces. Never again will an oppressor overrun my people, for now I am keeping watch. 
#Zc9-9: Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. 
#Zc9-10: I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the warhorses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River "to the ends of the earth. 
#Zc9-11: As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit. 
#Zc9-12: Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope; even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you. 
#Zc9-13: I will bend Judah as I bend my bow and fill it with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and make you like a warrior's sword. 
#Zc9-14: Then the LORD will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign LORD will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south, 
#Zc9-15: and the LORD Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling "the corners of the altar. 
#Zc9-16: The LORD their God will save his people on that day as a shepherd saves his flock. They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown. 
#Zc9-17: How attractive and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women.
 ZACARIAS 10
#Zc10-1: Ask the LORD for rain in the springtime; it is the LORD who sends the thunderstorms. He gives showers of rain to all people, and plants of the field to everyone. 
#Zc10-2: The idols speak deceitfully, diviners see visions that lie; they tell dreams that are false, they give comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd. 
#Zc10-3: "My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the LORD Almighty will care for his flock, the people of Judah, and make them like a proud horse in battle. 
#Zc10-4: From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler. 
#Zc10-5: Together they "will be like warriors in battle trampling their enemy into the mud of the streets. They will fight because the LORD is with them, and they will put the enemy horsemen to shame. 
#Zc10-6: "I will strengthen Judah and save the tribes of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. 
#Zc10-7: The Ephraimites will become like warriors, and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in the LORD. 
#Zc10-8: I will signal for them and gather them in. Surely I will redeem them; they will be as numerous as before. 
#Zc10-9: Though I scatter them among the peoples, yet in distant lands they will remember me. They and their children will survive, and they will return. 
#Zc10-10: I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be room enough for them. 
#Zc10-11: They will pass through the sea of trouble; the surging sea will be subdued and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. Assyria's pride will be brought down and Egypt's scepter will pass away. 
#Zc10-12: I will strengthen them in the LORD and in his name they will live securely," declares the LORD.
 ZACARIAS 11
#Zc11-1: Open your doors, Lebanon, so that fire may devour your cedars! 
#Zc11-2: Wail, you juniper, for the cedar has fallen; the stately trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan; the dense forest has been cut down! 
#Zc11-3: Listen to the wail of the shepherds; their rich pastures are destroyed! Listen to the roar of the lions; the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined! 
#Zc11-4: This is what the LORD my God says: "Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter. 
#Zc11-5: Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, 'Praise the LORD, I am rich!' Their own shepherds do not spare them. 
#Zc11-6: For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land," declares the LORD. "I will give everyone into the hands of their neighbors and their king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their hands." 
#Zc11-7: So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock. 
#Zc11-8: In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them 
#Zc11-9: and said, "I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another's flesh." 
#Zc11-10: Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations. 
#Zc11-11: It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the LORD. 
#Zc11-12: I told them, "If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it." So they paid me thirty pieces of silver. 
#Zc11-13: And the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter" —the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the LORD. 
#Zc11-14: Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the family bond between Judah and Israel. 
#Zc11-15: Then the LORD said to me, "Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd. 
#Zc11-16: For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hooves. 
#Zc11-17: "Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm be completely withered, his right eye totally blinded!"
 ZACARIAS 12
#Zc12-1: A prophecy: The word of the LORD concerning Israel. The LORD, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares: 
#Zc12-2: "I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. 
#Zc12-3: On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves. 
#Zc12-4: On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness," declares the LORD. "I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations. 
#Zc12-5: Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 'The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the LORD Almighty is their God.' 
#Zc12-6: "On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place. 
#Zc12-7: "The LORD will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem's inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah. 
#Zc12-8: On that day the LORD will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD going before them. 
#Zc12-9: On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem. 
#Zc12-10: "And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit "of grace and supplication. They will look on "me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son. 
#Zc12-11: On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 
#Zc12-12: The land will mourn, each clan by itself, with their wives by themselves: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives, 
#Zc12-13: the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives, 
#Zc12-14: and all the rest of the clans and their wives.
 ZACARIAS 13
#Zc13-1: "On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity. 
#Zc13-2: "On that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and they will be remembered no more," declares the LORD Almighty. "I will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land. 
#Zc13-3: And if anyone still prophesies, their father and mother, to whom they were born, will say to them, 'You must die, because you have told lies in the LORD's name.' Then their own parents will stab the one who prophesies. 
#Zc13-4: "On that day every prophet will be ashamed of their prophetic vision. They will not put on a prophet's garment of hair in order to deceive. 
#Zc13-5: Each will say, 'I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood since my youth. "' 
#Zc13-6: If someone asks, 'What are these wounds on your body "?' they will answer, 'The wounds I was given at the house of my friends.' 
#Zc13-7: "Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me!" declares the LORD Almighty. "Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones. 
#Zc13-8: In the whole land," declares the LORD, "two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it. 
#Zc13-9: This third I will put into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, 'They are my people,' and they will say, 'The LORD is our God.'"
 ZACARIAS 14
#Zc14-1: A day of the LORD is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls. 
#Zc14-2: I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city. 
#Zc14-3: Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle. 
#Zc14-4: On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. 
#Zc14-5: You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake "in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him. 
#Zc14-6: On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness. 
#Zc14-7: It will be a unique day —a day known only to the LORD —with no distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light. 
#Zc14-8: On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it east to the Dead Sea and half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea, in summer and in winter. 
#Zc14-9: The LORD will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one LORD, and his name the only name. 
#Zc14-10: The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up high from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses, and will remain in its place. 
#Zc14-11: It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure. 
#Zc14-12: This is the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. 
#Zc14-13: On that day people will be stricken by the LORD with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another. 
#Zc14-14: Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected —great quantities of gold and silver and clothing. 
#Zc14-15: A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps. 
#Zc14-16: Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, and to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles. 
#Zc14-17: If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, they will have no rain. 
#Zc14-18: If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The LORD "will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles. 
#Zc14-19: This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles. 
#Zc14-20: On that day HOLY TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the LORD's house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar. 
#Zc14-21: Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite "in the house of the LORD Almighty.
MALAQUIAS
 MALAQUIAS 1
#Ml1-1: A prophecy: The word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi. [^1] 
#Ml1-2: "I have loved you," says the LORD. "But you ask, 'How have you loved us?' "Was not Esau Jacob's brother?" declares the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob, 
#Ml1-3: but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his hill country into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals." 
#Ml1-4: Edom may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins." But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, a people always under the wrath of the LORD. 
#Ml1-5: You will see it with your own eyes and say, 'Great is the LORD —even beyond the borders of Israel!' 
#Ml1-6: "A son honors his father, and a slave his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?" says the LORD Almighty. "It is you priests who show contempt for my name. "But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?' 
#Ml1-7: "By offering defiled food on my altar. "But you ask, 'How have we defiled you?' "By saying that the LORD's table is contemptible. 
#Ml1-8: When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you sacrifice lame or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?" says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml1-9: "Now plead with God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your hands, will he accept you?" —says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml1-10: "Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not light useless fires on my altar! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD Almighty, "and I will accept no offering from your hands. 
#Ml1-11: My name will be great among the nations, from where the sun rises to where it sets. In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to me, because my name will be great among the nations," says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml1-12: "But you profane it by saying, 'The Lord's table is defiled,' and, 'Its food is contemptible.' 
#Ml1-13: And you say, 'What a burden!' and you sniff at it contemptuously," says the LORD Almighty. "When you bring injured, lame or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands?" says the LORD. 
#Ml1-14: "Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great king," says the LORD Almighty, "and my name is to be feared among the nations.
 MALAQUIAS 2
#Ml2-1: "And now, you priests, this warning is for you. 
#Ml2-2: If you do not listen, and if you do not resolve to honor my name," says the LORD Almighty, "I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not resolved to honor me. 
#Ml2-3: "Because of you I will rebuke your descendants "; I will smear on your faces the dung from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it. 
#Ml2-4: And you will know that I have sent you this warning so that my covenant with Levi may continue," says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml2-5: "My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name. 
#Ml2-6: True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin. 
#Ml2-7: "For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the LORD Almighty and people seek instruction from his mouth. 
#Ml2-8: But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi," says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml2-9: "So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law." 
#Ml2-10: Do we not all have one Father "? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our ancestors by being unfaithful to one another? 
#Ml2-11: Judah has been unfaithful. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the LORD loves by marrying women who worship a foreign god. 
#Ml2-12: As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the LORD remove him from the tents of Jacob "—even though he brings an offering to the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml2-13: Another thing you do: You flood the LORD's altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer looks with favor on your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands. 
#Ml2-14: You ask, "Why?" It is because the LORD is the witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant. 
#Ml2-15: Has not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And what does the one God seek? Godly offspring. "So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth. 
#Ml2-16: "The man who hates and divorces his wife," says the LORD, the God of Israel, "does violence to the one he should protect," "says the LORD Almighty. So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful. 
#Ml2-17: You have wearied the LORD with your words. "How have we wearied him?" you ask. By saying, "All who do evil are good in the eyes of the LORD, and he is pleased with them" or "Where is the God of justice?"
 MALAQUIAS 3
#Ml3-1: "I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come," says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml3-2: But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner's fire or a launderer's soap. 
#Ml3-3: He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the LORD will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness, 
#Ml3-4: and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the LORD, as in days gone by, as in former years. 
#Ml3-5: "So I will come to put you on trial. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive the foreigners among you of justice, but do not fear me," says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml3-6: "I the LORD do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed. 
#Ml3-7: Ever since the time of your ancestors you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you," says the LORD Almighty. "But you ask, 'How are we to return?' 
#Ml3-8: "Will a mere mortal rob God? Yet you rob me. "But you ask, 'How are we robbing you?' "In tithes and offerings. 
#Ml3-9: You are under a curse —your whole nation —because you are robbing me. 
#Ml3-10: Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the LORD Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it. 
#Ml3-11: I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe," says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml3-12: "Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful land," says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml3-13: "You have spoken arrogantly against me," says the LORD. "Yet you ask, 'What have we said against you?' 
#Ml3-14: "You have said, 'It is futile to serve God. What do we gain by carrying out his requirements and going about like mourners before the LORD Almighty? 
#Ml3-15: But now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly evildoers prosper, and even when they put God to the test, they get away with it.'" 
#Ml3-16: Then those who feared the LORD talked with each other, and the LORD listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in his presence concerning those who feared the LORD and honored his name. 
#Ml3-17: "On the day when I act," says the LORD Almighty, "they will be my treasured possession. I will spare them, just as a father has compassion and spares his son who serves him. 
#Ml3-18: And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.
 MALAQUIAS 4
#Ml4-1: "Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and the day that is coming will set them on fire," says the LORD Almighty. "Not a root or a branch will be left to them. 
#Ml4-2: But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays. And you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves. 
#Ml4-3: Then you will trample on the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act," says the LORD Almighty. 
#Ml4-4: "Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel. 
#Ml4-5: "See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the LORD comes. 
#Ml4-6: He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children to their parents; or else I will come and strike the land with total destruction."

#Mt1-17: Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah. 
#Mt1-18: This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about ": His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. 
#Mt1-19: Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet "did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

#Mt1-21: She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, "because he will save his people from their sins." 
#Mt1-22: All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 
#Mt1-23: "The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" "(which means "God with us"). 
#Mt1-24: When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. 
#Mt1-25: But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.

#Mt2-2: and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him." 
#Mt2-3: When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 
#Mt2-4: When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. 
#Mt2-5: "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written: 
#Mt2-6: "'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.' "" 
#Mt2-7: Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. 
#Mt2-8: He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him." 
#Mt2-9: After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. 
#Mt2-10: When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 
#Mt2-11: On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. 
#Mt2-12: And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route. 
#Mt2-13: When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him." 
#Mt2-14: So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 
#Mt2-15: where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." [^3] 
#Mt2-16: When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. 
#Mt2-17: Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: 
#Mt2-18: "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." [^4] 
#Mt2-19: After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 
#Mt2-20: and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead." 
#Mt2-21: So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. 
#Mt2-22: But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, 
#Mt2-23: and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
 MATEUS 3
#Mt3-1: In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea 
#Mt3-2: and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." 
#Mt3-3: This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" [^1] 
#Mt3-4: John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 
#Mt3-5: People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. 
#Mt3-6: Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 
#Mt3-7: But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
#Mt3-8: Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. 
#Mt3-9: And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
#Mt3-10: The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 
#Mt3-11: "I baptize you with "water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with "the Holy Spirit and fire. 
#Mt3-12: His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire." 
#Mt3-13: Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. 
#Mt3-14: But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" 
#Mt3-15: Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented. 
#Mt3-16: As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 
#Mt3-17: And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
 MATEUS 4
#Mt4-1: Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted "by the devil. 
#Mt4-2: After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 
#Mt4-3: The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread." 
#Mt4-4: Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' "" 
#Mt4-5: Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 
#Mt4-6: "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: "'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' "" 
#Mt4-7: Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' "" 
#Mt4-8: Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 
#Mt4-9: "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me." 
#Mt4-10: Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.' "" 
#Mt4-11: Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him. 
#Mt4-12: When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. 
#Mt4-13: Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali — 
#Mt4-14: to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: 
#Mt4-15: "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles — 
#Mt4-16: the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned." [^6] 
#Mt4-17: From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." 
#Mt4-18: As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 
#Mt4-19: "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people." 
#Mt4-20: At once they left their nets and followed him. 
#Mt4-21: Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, 
#Mt4-22: and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. 
#Mt4-23: Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. 
#Mt4-24: News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them. 
#Mt4-25: Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, "Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.
 MATEUS 5
#Mt5-1: Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, 
#Mt5-2: and he began to teach them. He said: 
#Mt5-3: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
#Mt5-4: Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. 
#Mt5-5: Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. 
#Mt5-6: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. 
#Mt5-7: Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. 
#Mt5-8: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. 
#Mt5-9: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. 
#Mt5-10: Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
#Mt5-11: "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 
#Mt5-12: Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. 
#Mt5-13: "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. 
#Mt5-14: "You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 
#Mt5-15: Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 
#Mt5-16: In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. 
#Mt5-17: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 
#Mt5-18: For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 
#Mt5-19: Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
#Mt5-20: For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. 
#Mt5-21: "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder, "and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' 
#Mt5-22: But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister ""will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' "is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. 
#Mt5-23: "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, 
#Mt5-24: leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift. 
#Mt5-25: "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 
#Mt5-26: Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. 
#Mt5-27: "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' [^5] 
#Mt5-28: But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 
#Mt5-29: If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 
#Mt5-30: And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. 
#Mt5-31: "It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' [^6] 
#Mt5-32: But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 
#Mt5-33: "Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.' 
#Mt5-34: But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; 
#Mt5-35: or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 
#Mt5-36: And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 
#Mt5-37: All you need to say is simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. [^7] 
#Mt5-38: "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' [^8] 
#Mt5-39: But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. 
#Mt5-40: And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. 
#Mt5-41: If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. 
#Mt5-42: Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. 
#Mt5-43: "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor "and hate your enemy.' 
#Mt5-44: But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 
#Mt5-45: that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 
#Mt5-46: If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 
#Mt5-47: And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 
#Mt5-48: Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
 MATEUS 6
#Mt6-1: "Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. 
#Mt6-2: "So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 
#Mt6-3: But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 
#Mt6-4: so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 
#Mt6-5: "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 
#Mt6-6: But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 
#Mt6-7: And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 
#Mt6-8: Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 
#Mt6-9: "This, then, is how you should pray: "'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, 
#Mt6-10: your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. 
#Mt6-11: Give us today our daily bread. 
#Mt6-12: And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 
#Mt6-13: And lead us not into temptation, "but deliver us from the evil one. "' 
#Mt6-14: For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 
#Mt6-15: But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. 
#Mt6-16: "When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 
#Mt6-17: But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 
#Mt6-18: so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 
#Mt6-19: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 
#Mt6-20: But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 
#Mt6-21: For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 
#Mt6-22: "The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, "your whole body will be full of light. 
#Mt6-23: But if your eyes are unhealthy, "your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! 
#Mt6-24: "No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. 
#Mt6-25: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 
#Mt6-26: Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 
#Mt6-27: Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life "? 
#Mt6-28: "And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 
#Mt6-29: Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 
#Mt6-30: If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you —you of little faith? 
#Mt6-31: So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' 
#Mt6-32: For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 
#Mt6-33: But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 
#Mt6-34: Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
 MATEUS 7
#Mt7-1: "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 
#Mt7-2: For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. 
#Mt7-3: "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 
#Mt7-4: How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 
#Mt7-5: You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. 
#Mt7-6: "Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. 
#Mt7-7: "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 
#Mt7-8: For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. 
#Mt7-9: "Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 
#Mt7-10: Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 
#Mt7-11: If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! 
#Mt7-12: So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. 
#Mt7-13: "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 
#Mt7-14: But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it. 
#Mt7-15: "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 
#Mt7-16: By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 
#Mt7-17: Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 
#Mt7-18: A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 
#Mt7-19: Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
#Mt7-20: Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them. 
#Mt7-21: "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 
#Mt7-22: Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' 
#Mt7-23: Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' 
#Mt7-24: "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 
#Mt7-25: The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 
#Mt7-26: But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 
#Mt7-27: The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash." 
#Mt7-28: When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, 
#Mt7-29: because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
 MATEUS 8
#Mt8-1: When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. 
#Mt8-2: A man with leprosy "came and knelt before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." 
#Mt8-3: Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. 
#Mt8-4: Then Jesus said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." 
#Mt8-5: When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. 
#Mt8-6: "Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly." 
#Mt8-7: Jesus said to him, "Shall I come and heal him?" 
#Mt8-8: The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
#Mt8-9: For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." 
#Mt8-10: When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. 
#Mt8-11: I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 
#Mt8-12: But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 
#Mt8-13: Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that moment. 
#Mt8-14: When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. 
#Mt8-15: He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him. 
#Mt8-16: When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. 
#Mt8-17: This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases." [^2] 
#Mt8-18: When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. 
#Mt8-19: Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." 
#Mt8-20: Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." 
#Mt8-21: Another disciple said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father." 
#Mt8-22: But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." 
#Mt8-23: Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. 
#Mt8-24: Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. 
#Mt8-25: The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!" 
#Mt8-26: He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. 
#Mt8-27: The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" 
#Mt8-28: When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, "two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. 
#Mt8-29: "What do you want with us, Son of God?" they shouted. "Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?" 
#Mt8-30: Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. 
#Mt8-31: The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs." 
#Mt8-32: He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. 
#Mt8-33: Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 
#Mt8-34: Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
 MATEUS 9
#Mt9-1: Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town. 
#Mt9-2: Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven." 
#Mt9-3: At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!" 
#Mt9-4: Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts? 
#Mt9-5: Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? 
#Mt9-6: But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home." 
#Mt9-7: Then the man got up and went home. 
#Mt9-8: When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man. 
#Mt9-9: As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. 
#Mt9-10: While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. 
#Mt9-11: When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?" 
#Mt9-12: On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 
#Mt9-13: But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' "For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." 
#Mt9-14: Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?" 
#Mt9-15: Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. 
#Mt9-16: "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. 
#Mt9-17: Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved." 
#Mt9-18: While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live." 
#Mt9-19: Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. 
#Mt9-20: Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. 
#Mt9-21: She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed." 
#Mt9-22: Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment. 
#Mt9-23: When Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, 
#Mt9-24: he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep." But they laughed at him. 
#Mt9-25: After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. 
#Mt9-26: News of this spread through all that region. 
#Mt9-27: As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!" 
#Mt9-28: When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied. 
#Mt9-29: Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you"; 
#Mt9-30: and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, "See that no one knows about this." 
#Mt9-31: But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region. 
#Mt9-32: While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. 
#Mt9-33: And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel." 
#Mt9-34: But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons." 
#Mt9-35: Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. 
#Mt9-36: When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
#Mt9-37: Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. 
#Mt9-38: Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."
 MATEUS 10
#Mt10-1: Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. 
#Mt10-2: These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; 
#Mt10-3: Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 
#Mt10-4: Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. 
#Mt10-5: These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. 
#Mt10-6: Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. 
#Mt10-7: As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.' 
#Mt10-8: Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, "drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. 
#Mt10-9: "Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts — 
#Mt10-10: no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. 
#Mt10-11: Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. 
#Mt10-12: As you enter the home, give it your greeting. 
#Mt10-13: If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. 
#Mt10-14: If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. 
#Mt10-15: Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. 
#Mt10-16: "I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. 
#Mt10-17: Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues. 
#Mt10-18: On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. 
#Mt10-19: But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, 
#Mt10-20: for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. 
#Mt10-21: "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. 
#Mt10-22: You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 
#Mt10-23: When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. 
#Mt10-24: "The student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master. 
#Mt10-25: It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! 
#Mt10-26: "So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. 
#Mt10-27: What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. 
#Mt10-28: Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. 
#Mt10-29: Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care. [^2] 
#Mt10-30: And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 
#Mt10-31: So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 
#Mt10-32: "Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. 
#Mt10-33: But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. 
#Mt10-34: "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. 
#Mt10-35: For I have come to turn "'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law — 
#Mt10-36: a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.' [^3] 
#Mt10-37: "Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
#Mt10-38: Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 
#Mt10-39: Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. 
#Mt10-40: "Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. 
#Mt10-41: Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. 
#Mt10-42: And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward."
 MATEUS 11
#Mt11-1: After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. [^1] 
#Mt11-2: When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples 
#Mt11-3: to ask him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?" 
#Mt11-4: Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see: 
#Mt11-5: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy "are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. 
#Mt11-6: Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me." 
#Mt11-7: As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? 
#Mt11-8: If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces. 
#Mt11-9: Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 
#Mt11-10: This is the one about whom it is written: "'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' [^3] 
#Mt11-11: Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
#Mt11-12: From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, "and violent people have been raiding it. 
#Mt11-13: For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. 
#Mt11-14: And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. 
#Mt11-15: Whoever has ears, let them hear. 
#Mt11-16: "To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: 
#Mt11-17: "'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.' 
#Mt11-18: For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' 
#Mt11-19: The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds." 
#Mt11-20: Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. 
#Mt11-21: "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
#Mt11-22: But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. 
#Mt11-23: And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. "For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. 
#Mt11-24: But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." 
#Mt11-25: At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. 
#Mt11-26: Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. 
#Mt11-27: "All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. 
#Mt11-28: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 
#Mt11-29: Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 
#Mt11-30: For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
 MATEUS 12
#Mt12-1: At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. 
#Mt12-2: When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath." 
#Mt12-3: He answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 
#Mt12-4: He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread —which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. 
#Mt12-5: Or haven't you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent? 
#Mt12-6: I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. 
#Mt12-7: If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' "you would not have condemned the innocent. 
#Mt12-8: For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." 
#Mt12-9: Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, 
#Mt12-10: and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" 
#Mt12-11: He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? 
#Mt12-12: How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath." 
#Mt12-13: Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. 
#Mt12-14: But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. 
#Mt12-15: Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill. 
#Mt12-16: He warned them not to tell others about him. 
#Mt12-17: This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 
#Mt12-18: "Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. 
#Mt12-19: He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets. 
#Mt12-20: A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory. 
#Mt12-21: In his name the nations will put their hope." [^2] 
#Mt12-22: Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. 
#Mt12-23: All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?" 
#Mt12-24: But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons." 
#Mt12-25: Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. 
#Mt12-26: If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? 
#Mt12-27: And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. 
#Mt12-28: But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 
#Mt12-29: "Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. 
#Mt12-30: "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. 
#Mt12-31: And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 
#Mt12-32: Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. 
#Mt12-33: "Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. 
#Mt12-34: You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. 
#Mt12-35: A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. 
#Mt12-36: But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken. 
#Mt12-37: For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned." 
#Mt12-38: Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you." 
#Mt12-39: He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 
#Mt12-40: For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 
#Mt12-41: The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here. 
#Mt12-42: The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here. 
#Mt12-43: "When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. 
#Mt12-44: Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. 
#Mt12-45: Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation." 
#Mt12-46: While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. 
#Mt12-47: Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you." 
#Mt12-48: He replied to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?" 
#Mt12-49: Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers. 
#Mt12-50: For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
 MATEUS 13
#Mt13-1: That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. 
#Mt13-2: Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. 
#Mt13-3: Then he told them many things in parables, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed. 
#Mt13-4: As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. 
#Mt13-5: Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 
#Mt13-6: But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 
#Mt13-7: Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. 
#Mt13-8: Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop —a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 
#Mt13-9: Whoever has ears, let them hear." 
#Mt13-10: The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?" 
#Mt13-11: He replied, "Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. 
#Mt13-12: Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 
#Mt13-13: This is why I speak to them in parables: "Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. 
#Mt13-14: In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. 
#Mt13-15: For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' [^1] 
#Mt13-16: But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. 
#Mt13-17: For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. 
#Mt13-18: "Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: 
#Mt13-19: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. 
#Mt13-20: The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. 
#Mt13-21: But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. 
#Mt13-22: The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. 
#Mt13-23: But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown." 
#Mt13-24: Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 
#Mt13-25: But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. 
#Mt13-26: When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. 
#Mt13-27: "The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' 
#Mt13-28: "'An enemy did this,' he replied. "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' 
#Mt13-29: "'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. 
#Mt13-30: Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'" 
#Mt13-31: He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. 
#Mt13-32: Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches." 
#Mt13-33: He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds "of flour until it worked all through the dough." 
#Mt13-34: Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. 
#Mt13-35: So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world." [^3] 
#Mt13-36: Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field." 
#Mt13-37: He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. 
#Mt13-38: The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, 
#Mt13-39: and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. 
#Mt13-40: "As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. 
#Mt13-41: The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. 
#Mt13-42: They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
#Mt13-43: Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear. 
#Mt13-44: "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. 
#Mt13-45: "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. 
#Mt13-46: When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. 
#Mt13-47: "Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. 
#Mt13-48: When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. 
#Mt13-49: This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous 
#Mt13-50: and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
#Mt13-51: "Have you understood all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they replied. 
#Mt13-52: He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." 
#Mt13-53: When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. 
#Mt13-54: Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?" they asked. 
#Mt13-55: "Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? 
#Mt13-56: Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?" 
#Mt13-57: And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home." 
#Mt13-58: And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
 MATEUS 14
#Mt14-1: At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus, 
#Mt14-2: and he said to his attendants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him." 
#Mt14-3: Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, 
#Mt14-4: for John had been saying to him: "It is not lawful for you to have her." 
#Mt14-5: Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet. 
#Mt14-6: On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much 
#Mt14-7: that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 
#Mt14-8: Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist." 
#Mt14-9: The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted 
#Mt14-10: and had John beheaded in the prison. 
#Mt14-11: His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. 
#Mt14-12: John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. 
#Mt14-13: When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns. 
#Mt14-14: When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick. 
#Mt14-15: As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food." 
#Mt14-16: Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat." 
#Mt14-17: "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered. 
#Mt14-18: "Bring them here to me," he said. 
#Mt14-19: And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 
#Mt14-20: They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 
#Mt14-21: The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children. 
#Mt14-22: Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. 
#Mt14-23: After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, 
#Mt14-24: and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. 
#Mt14-25: Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. 
#Mt14-26: When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear. 
#Mt14-27: But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." 
#Mt14-28: "Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come to you on the water." 
#Mt14-29: "Come," he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. 
#Mt14-30: But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!" 
#Mt14-31: Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?" 
#Mt14-32: And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. 
#Mt14-33: Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." 
#Mt14-34: When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. 
#Mt14-35: And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him 
#Mt14-36: and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
 MATEUS 15
#Mt15-1: Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, 
#Mt15-2: "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!" 
#Mt15-3: Jesus replied, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? 
#Mt15-4: For God said, 'Honor your father and mother' "and 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.' [^2] 
#Mt15-5: But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is 'devoted to God,' 
#Mt15-6: they are not to 'honor their father or mother' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. 
#Mt15-7: You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: 
#Mt15-8: "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. 
#Mt15-9: They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.' "" 
#Mt15-10: Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand. 
#Mt15-11: What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them." 
#Mt15-12: Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?" 
#Mt15-13: He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. 
#Mt15-14: Leave them; they are blind guides. "If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit." 
#Mt15-15: Peter said, "Explain the parable to us." 
#Mt15-16: "Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked them. 
#Mt15-17: "Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? 
#Mt15-18: But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. 
#Mt15-19: For out of the heart come evil thoughts —murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. 
#Mt15-20: These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them." 
#Mt15-21: Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
#Mt15-22: A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly." 
#Mt15-23: Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us." 
#Mt15-24: He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel." 
#Mt15-25: The woman came and knelt before him. "Lord, help me!" she said. 
#Mt15-26: He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs." 
#Mt15-27: "Yes it is, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table." 
#Mt15-28: Then Jesus said to her, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed at that moment. 
#Mt15-29: Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. 
#Mt15-30: Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. 
#Mt15-31: The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. 
#Mt15-32: Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way." 
#Mt15-33: His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?" 
#Mt15-34: "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish." 
#Mt15-35: He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. 
#Mt15-36: Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. 
#Mt15-37: They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 
#Mt15-38: The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children. 
#Mt15-39: After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.
 MATEUS 16
#Mt16-1: The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. 
#Mt16-2: He replied, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,' 
#Mt16-3: and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. [^1] 
#Mt16-4: A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah." Jesus then left them and went away. 
#Mt16-5: When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. 
#Mt16-6: "Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." 
#Mt16-7: They discussed this among themselves and said, "It is because we didn't bring any bread." 
#Mt16-8: Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? 
#Mt16-9: Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 
#Mt16-10: Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 
#Mt16-11: How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." 
#Mt16-12: Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
#Mt16-13: When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?" 
#Mt16-14: They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets." 
#Mt16-15: "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" 
#Mt16-16: Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." 
#Mt16-17: Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. 
#Mt16-18: And I tell you that you are Peter, "and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades "will not overcome it. 
#Mt16-19: I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be "bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be "loosed in heaven." 
#Mt16-20: Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. 
#Mt16-21: From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. 
#Mt16-22: Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!" 
#Mt16-23: Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns." 
#Mt16-24: Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. 
#Mt16-25: For whoever wants to save their life "will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. 
#Mt16-26: What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? 
#Mt16-27: For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. 
#Mt16-28: "Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
 MATEUS 17
#Mt17-1: After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. 
#Mt17-2: There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. 
#Mt17-3: Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus. 
#Mt17-4: Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters —one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." 
#Mt17-5: While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!" 
#Mt17-6: When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. 
#Mt17-7: But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid." 
#Mt17-8: When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus. 
#Mt17-9: As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead." 
#Mt17-10: The disciples asked him, "Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" 
#Mt17-11: Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. 
#Mt17-12: But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands." 
#Mt17-13: Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. 
#Mt17-14: When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him. 
#Mt17-15: "Lord, have mercy on my son," he said. "He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. 
#Mt17-16: I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him." 
#Mt17-17: "You unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me." 
#Mt17-18: Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment. 
#Mt17-19: Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?" 
#Mt17-20: He replied, "Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you." 
#Mt17-21:  
#Mt17-22: When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. 
#Mt17-23: They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life." And the disciples were filled with grief. 
#Mt17-24: After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?" 
#Mt17-25: "Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes —from their own children or from others?" 
#Mt17-26: "From others," Peter answered. "Then the children are exempt," Jesus said to him. 
#Mt17-27: "But so that we may not cause offense, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."
 MATEUS 18
#Mt18-1: At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" 
#Mt18-2: He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them. 
#Mt18-3: And he said: "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
#Mt18-4: Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
#Mt18-5: And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me. 
#Mt18-6: "If anyone causes one of these little ones —those who believe in me —to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. 
#Mt18-7: Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come! 
#Mt18-8: If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. 
#Mt18-9: And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. 
#Mt18-10: "See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. 
#Mt18-11:  
#Mt18-12: "What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? 
#Mt18-13: And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. 
#Mt18-14: In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. 
#Mt18-15: "If your brother or sister "sins, "go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. 
#Mt18-16: But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' [^4] 
#Mt18-17: If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. 
#Mt18-18: "Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be "bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be "loosed in heaven. 
#Mt18-19: "Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. 
#Mt18-20: For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." 
#Mt18-21: Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?" 
#Mt18-22: Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. [^7] 
#Mt18-23: "Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 
#Mt18-24: As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold "was brought to him. 
#Mt18-25: Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. 
#Mt18-26: "At this the servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' 
#Mt18-27: The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. 
#Mt18-28: "But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. "He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded. 
#Mt18-29: "His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.' 
#Mt18-30: "But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. 
#Mt18-31: When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened. 
#Mt18-32: "Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. 
#Mt18-33: Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?' 
#Mt18-34: In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. 
#Mt18-35: "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
 MATEUS 19
#Mt19-1: When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. 
#Mt19-2: Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. 
#Mt19-3: Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?" 
#Mt19-4: "Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,' [^1] 
#Mt19-5: and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh' "? 
#Mt19-6: So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." 
#Mt19-7: "Why then," they asked, "did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?" 
#Mt19-8: Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 
#Mt19-9: I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery." 
#Mt19-10: The disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry." 
#Mt19-11: Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. 
#Mt19-12: For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others —and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it." 
#Mt19-13: Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. 
#Mt19-14: Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." 
#Mt19-15: When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there. 
#Mt19-16: Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?" 
#Mt19-17: "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments." 
#Mt19-18: "Which ones?" he inquired. Jesus replied, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, 
#Mt19-19: honor your father and mother,' "and 'love your neighbor as yourself.' "" 
#Mt19-20: "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?" 
#Mt19-21: Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." 
#Mt19-22: When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. 
#Mt19-23: Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. 
#Mt19-24: Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." 
#Mt19-25: When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?" 
#Mt19-26: Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible." 
#Mt19-27: Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?" 
#Mt19-28: Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
#Mt19-29: And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife "or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. 
#Mt19-30: But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
 MATEUS 20
#Mt20-1: "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 
#Mt20-2: He agreed to pay them a denarius "for the day and sent them into his vineyard. 
#Mt20-3: "About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. 
#Mt20-4: He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.' 
#Mt20-5: So they went. "He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing. 
#Mt20-6: About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?' 
#Mt20-7: "'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.' 
#Mt20-8: "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.' 
#Mt20-9: "The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. 
#Mt20-10: So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. 
#Mt20-11: When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 
#Mt20-12: 'These who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.' 
#Mt20-13: "But he answered one of them, 'I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? 
#Mt20-14: Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. 
#Mt20-15: Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?' 
#Mt20-16: "So the last will be first, and the first will be last." 
#Mt20-17: Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and said to them, 
#Mt20-18: "We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death 
#Mt20-19: and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!" 
#Mt20-20: Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him. 
#Mt20-21: "What is it you want?" he asked. She said, "Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom." 
#Mt20-22: "You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?" "We can," they answered. 
#Mt20-23: Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father." 
#Mt20-24: When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. 
#Mt20-25: Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 
#Mt20-26: Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 
#Mt20-27: and whoever wants to be first must be your slave — 
#Mt20-28: just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." 
#Mt20-29: As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. 
#Mt20-30: Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!" 
#Mt20-31: The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!" 
#Mt20-32: Jesus stopped and called them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked. 
#Mt20-33: "Lord," they answered, "we want our sight." 
#Mt20-34: Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.
 MATEUS 21
#Mt21-1: As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, 
#Mt21-2: saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. 
#Mt21-3: If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away." 
#Mt21-4: This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: 
#Mt21-5: "Say to Daughter Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" [^1] 
#Mt21-6: The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. 
#Mt21-7: They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on. 
#Mt21-8: A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 
#Mt21-9: The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, "Hosanna "to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" ""Hosanna "in the highest heaven!" 
#Mt21-10: When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?" 
#Mt21-11: The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." 
#Mt21-12: Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. 
#Mt21-13: "It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be called a house of prayer,' "but you are making it 'a den of robbers.' "" 
#Mt21-14: The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. 
#Mt21-15: But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant. 
#Mt21-16: "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, "'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise' "?" 
#Mt21-17: And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night. 
#Mt21-18: Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. 
#Mt21-19: Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered. 
#Mt21-20: When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked. 
#Mt21-21: Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. 
#Mt21-22: If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." 
#Mt21-23: Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?" 
#Mt21-24: Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 
#Mt21-25: John's baptism —where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' 
#Mt21-26: But if we say, 'Of human origin' —we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet." 
#Mt21-27: So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Then he said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 
#Mt21-28: "What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.' 
#Mt21-29: "'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. 
#Mt21-30: "Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go. 
#Mt21-31: "Which of the two did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. 
#Mt21-32: For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. 
#Mt21-33: "Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. 
#Mt21-34: When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. 
#Mt21-35: "The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. 
#Mt21-36: Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. 
#Mt21-37: Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said. 
#Mt21-38: "But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.' 
#Mt21-39: So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 
#Mt21-40: "Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?" 
#Mt21-41: "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end," they replied, "and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time." 
#Mt21-42: Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: "'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes' "? 
#Mt21-43: "Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. 
#Mt21-44: Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed." [^9] 
#Mt21-45: When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them. 
#Mt21-46: They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.
 MATEUS 22
#Mt22-1: Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 
#Mt22-2: "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 
#Mt22-3: He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. 
#Mt22-4: "Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' 
#Mt22-5: "But they paid no attention and went off —one to his field, another to his business. 
#Mt22-6: The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 
#Mt22-7: The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 
#Mt22-8: "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 
#Mt22-9: So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 
#Mt22-10: So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 
#Mt22-11: "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 
#Mt22-12: He asked, 'How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?' The man was speechless. 
#Mt22-13: "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 
#Mt22-14: "For many are invited, but few are chosen." 
#Mt22-15: Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. 
#Mt22-16: They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are. 
#Mt22-17: Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax "to Caesar or not?" 
#Mt22-18: But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me? 
#Mt22-19: Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius, 
#Mt22-20: and he asked them, "Whose image is this? And whose inscription?" 
#Mt22-21: "Caesar's," they replied. Then he said to them, "So give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." 
#Mt22-22: When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. 
#Mt22-23: That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. 
#Mt22-24: "Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. 
#Mt22-25: Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. 
#Mt22-26: The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. 
#Mt22-27: Finally, the woman died. 
#Mt22-28: Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?" 
#Mt22-29: Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. 
#Mt22-30: At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. 
#Mt22-31: But about the resurrection of the dead —have you not read what God said to you, 
#Mt22-32: 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' "? He is not the God of the dead but of the living." 
#Mt22-33: When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. 
#Mt22-34: Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. 
#Mt22-35: One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: 
#Mt22-36: "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?" 
#Mt22-37: Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' [^3] 
#Mt22-38: This is the first and greatest commandment. 
#Mt22-39: And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' [^4] 
#Mt22-40: All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." 
#Mt22-41: While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
#Mt22-42: "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied. 
#Mt22-43: He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says, 
#Mt22-44: "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."' [^5] 
#Mt22-45: If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?" 
#Mt22-46: No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.
 MATEUS 23
#Mt23-1: Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: 
#Mt23-2: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. 
#Mt23-3: So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. 
#Mt23-4: They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. 
#Mt23-5: "Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries "wide and the tassels on their garments long; 
#Mt23-6: they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; 
#Mt23-7: they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called 'Rabbi' by others. 
#Mt23-8: "But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. 
#Mt23-9: And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. 
#Mt23-10: Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. 
#Mt23-11: The greatest among you will be your servant. 
#Mt23-12: For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted. 
#Mt23-13: "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. 
#Mt23-14:  
#Mt23-15: "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are. 
#Mt23-16: "Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.' 
#Mt23-17: You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? 
#Mt23-18: You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.' 
#Mt23-19: You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? 
#Mt23-20: Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. 
#Mt23-21: And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. 
#Mt23-22: And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. 
#Mt23-23: "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices —mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law —justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. 
#Mt23-24: You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. 
#Mt23-25: "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 
#Mt23-26: Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. 
#Mt23-27: "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. 
#Mt23-28: In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. 
#Mt23-29: "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. 
#Mt23-30: And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' 
#Mt23-31: So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. 
#Mt23-32: Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started! 
#Mt23-33: "You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? 
#Mt23-34: Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. 
#Mt23-35: And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 
#Mt23-36: Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation. 
#Mt23-37: "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. 
#Mt23-38: Look, your house is left to you desolate. 
#Mt23-39: For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' ""
 MATEUS 24
#Mt24-1: Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. 
#Mt24-2: "Do you see all these things?" he asked. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down." 
#Mt24-3: As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" 
#Mt24-4: Jesus answered: "Watch out that no one deceives you. 
#Mt24-5: For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah,' and will deceive many. 
#Mt24-6: You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 
#Mt24-7: Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 
#Mt24-8: All these are the beginning of birth pains. 
#Mt24-9: "Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 
#Mt24-10: At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 
#Mt24-11: and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 
#Mt24-12: Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 
#Mt24-13: but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 
#Mt24-14: And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. 
#Mt24-15: "So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' "spoken of through the prophet Daniel —let the reader understand — 
#Mt24-16: then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 
#Mt24-17: Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. 
#Mt24-18: Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. 
#Mt24-19: How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 
#Mt24-20: Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. 
#Mt24-21: For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now —and never to be equaled again. 
#Mt24-22: "If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. 
#Mt24-23: At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. 
#Mt24-24: For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 
#Mt24-25: See, I have told you ahead of time. 
#Mt24-26: "So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. 
#Mt24-27: For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 
#Mt24-28: Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. 
#Mt24-29: "Immediately after the distress of those days "'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' [^2] 
#Mt24-30: "Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth "will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. [^4] 
#Mt24-31: And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. 
#Mt24-32: "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. 
#Mt24-33: Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it "is near, right at the door. 
#Mt24-34: Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 
#Mt24-35: Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 
#Mt24-36: "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, "but only the Father. 
#Mt24-37: As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 
#Mt24-38: For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 
#Mt24-39: and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 
#Mt24-40: Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. 
#Mt24-41: Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. 
#Mt24-42: "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. 
#Mt24-43: But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. 
#Mt24-44: So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. 
#Mt24-45: "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? 
#Mt24-46: It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. 
#Mt24-47: Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 
#Mt24-48: But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' 
#Mt24-49: and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. 
#Mt24-50: The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. 
#Mt24-51: He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
 MATEUS 25
#Mt25-1: "At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 
#Mt25-2: Five of them were foolish and five were wise. 
#Mt25-3: The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. 
#Mt25-4: The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. 
#Mt25-5: The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. 
#Mt25-6: "At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!' 
#Mt25-7: "Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 
#Mt25-8: The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.' 
#Mt25-9: "'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.' 
#Mt25-10: "But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. 
#Mt25-11: "Later the others also came. 'Lord, Lord,' they said, 'open the door for us!' 
#Mt25-12: "But he replied, 'Truly I tell you, I don't know you.' 
#Mt25-13: "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour. 
#Mt25-14: "Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. 
#Mt25-15: To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, "each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. 
#Mt25-16: The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 
#Mt25-17: So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 
#Mt25-18: But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. 
#Mt25-19: "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 
#Mt25-20: The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.' 
#Mt25-21: "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' 
#Mt25-22: "The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.' 
#Mt25-23: "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' 
#Mt25-24: "Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 
#Mt25-25: So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.' 
#Mt25-26: "His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 
#Mt25-27: Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. 
#Mt25-28: "'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 
#Mt25-29: For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 
#Mt25-30: And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 
#Mt25-31: "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 
#Mt25-32: All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 
#Mt25-33: He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 
#Mt25-34: "Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 
#Mt25-35: For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 
#Mt25-36: I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' 
#Mt25-37: "Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 
#Mt25-38: When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 
#Mt25-39: When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' 
#Mt25-40: "The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' 
#Mt25-41: "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 
#Mt25-42: For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 
#Mt25-43: I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' 
#Mt25-44: "They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' 
#Mt25-45: "He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' 
#Mt25-46: "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."
 MATEUS 26
#Mt26-1: When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, 
#Mt26-2: "As you know, the Passover is two days away —and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified." 
#Mt26-3: Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, 
#Mt26-4: and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. 
#Mt26-5: "But not during the festival," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people." 
#Mt26-6: While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper, 
#Mt26-7: a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. 
#Mt26-8: When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked. 
#Mt26-9: "This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor." 
#Mt26-10: Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. 
#Mt26-11: The poor you will always have with you, "but you will not always have me. 
#Mt26-12: When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. 
#Mt26-13: Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her." 
#Mt26-14: Then one of the Twelve —the one called Judas Iscariot —went to the chief priests 
#Mt26-15: and asked, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?" So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver. 
#Mt26-16: From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over. 
#Mt26-17: On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?" 
#Mt26-18: He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'" 
#Mt26-19: So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. 
#Mt26-20: When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. 
#Mt26-21: And while they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me." 
#Mt26-22: They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely you don't mean me, Lord?" 
#Mt26-23: Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. 
#Mt26-24: The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born." 
#Mt26-25: Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely you don't mean me, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "You have said so." 
#Mt26-26: While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body." 
#Mt26-27: Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you. 
#Mt26-28: This is my blood of the "covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 
#Mt26-29: I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom." 
#Mt26-30: When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
#Mt26-31: Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' [^3] 
#Mt26-32: But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." 
#Mt26-33: Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will." 
#Mt26-34: "Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." 
#Mt26-35: But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same. 
#Mt26-36: Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." 
#Mt26-37: He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. 
#Mt26-38: Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me." 
#Mt26-39: Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will." 
#Mt26-40: Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter. 
#Mt26-41: "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." 
#Mt26-42: He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done." 
#Mt26-43: When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. 
#Mt26-44: So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing. 
#Mt26-45: Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. 
#Mt26-46: Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!" 
#Mt26-47: While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. 
#Mt26-48: Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him." 
#Mt26-49: Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him. 
#Mt26-50: Jesus replied, "Do what you came for, friend." "Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. 
#Mt26-51: With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. 
#Mt26-52: "Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. 
#Mt26-53: Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? 
#Mt26-54: But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?" 
#Mt26-55: In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. 
#Mt26-56: But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. 
#Mt26-57: Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. 
#Mt26-58: But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. 
#Mt26-59: The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. 
#Mt26-60: But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward 
#Mt26-61: and declared, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'" 
#Mt26-62: Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?" 
#Mt26-63: But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God." 
#Mt26-64: "You have said so," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven." [^5] 
#Mt26-65: Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. 
#Mt26-66: What do you think?" "He is worthy of death," they answered. 
#Mt26-67: Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him 
#Mt26-68: and said, "Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?" 
#Mt26-69: Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said. 
#Mt26-70: But he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said. 
#Mt26-71: Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth." 
#Mt26-72: He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!" 
#Mt26-73: After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away." 
#Mt26-74: Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed. 
#Mt26-75: Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
 MATEUS 27
#Mt27-1: Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have Jesus executed. 
#Mt27-2: So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor. 
#Mt27-3: When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 
#Mt27-4: "I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood." "What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility." 
#Mt27-5: So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. 
#Mt27-6: The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money." 
#Mt27-7: So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. 
#Mt27-8: That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 
#Mt27-9: Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, 
#Mt27-10: and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." [^1] 
#Mt27-11: Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "You have said so," Jesus replied. 
#Mt27-12: When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. 
#Mt27-13: Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?" 
#Mt27-14: But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge —to the great amazement of the governor. 
#Mt27-15: Now it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. 
#Mt27-16: At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus "Barabbas. 
#Mt27-17: So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?" 
#Mt27-18: For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him. 
#Mt27-19: While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him." 
#Mt27-20: But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. 
#Mt27-21: "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered. 
#Mt27-22: "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!" 
#Mt27-23: "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!" 
#Mt27-24: When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!" 
#Mt27-25: All the people answered, "His blood is on us and on our children!" 
#Mt27-26: Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. 
#Mt27-27: Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. 
#Mt27-28: They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, 
#Mt27-29: and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said. 
#Mt27-30: They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. 
#Mt27-31: After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. 
#Mt27-32: As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. 
#Mt27-33: They came to a place called Golgotha (which means "the place of the skull"). 
#Mt27-34: There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. 
#Mt27-35: When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. 
#Mt27-36: And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. 
#Mt27-37: Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
#Mt27-38: Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. 
#Mt27-39: Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads 
#Mt27-40: and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!" 
#Mt27-41: In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. 
#Mt27-42: "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. 
#Mt27-43: He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" 
#Mt27-44: In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. 
#Mt27-45: From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. 
#Mt27-46: About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "(which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" ). [^4] 
#Mt27-47: When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah." 
#Mt27-48: Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. 
#Mt27-49: The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him." 
#Mt27-50: And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. 
#Mt27-51: At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split 
#Mt27-52: and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. 
#Mt27-53: They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and "went into the holy city and appeared to many people. 
#Mt27-54: When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!" 
#Mt27-55: Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. 
#Mt27-56: Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, "and the mother of Zebedee's sons. 
#Mt27-57: As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. 
#Mt27-58: Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. 
#Mt27-59: Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
#Mt27-60: and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. 
#Mt27-61: Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. 
#Mt27-62: The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. 
#Mt27-63: "Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' 
#Mt27-64: So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first." 
#Mt27-65: "Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how." 
#Mt27-66: So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
 MATEUS 28
#Mt28-1: After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. 
#Mt28-2: There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. 
#Mt28-3: His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 
#Mt28-4: The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. 
#Mt28-5: The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 
#Mt28-6: He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 
#Mt28-7: Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you." 
#Mt28-8: So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 
#Mt28-9: Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. 
#Mt28-10: Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." 
#Mt28-11: While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. 
#Mt28-12: When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, 
#Mt28-13: telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' 
#Mt28-14: If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." 
#Mt28-15: So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. 
#Mt28-16: Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 
#Mt28-17: When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 
#Mt28-18: Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
#Mt28-19: Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
#Mt28-20: and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
MARCOS
 MARCOS 1
#Mc1-1: The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, "the Son of God, [^2] 
#Mc1-2: as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" "— 
#Mc1-3: "a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" [^4] 
#Mc1-4: And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 
#Mc1-5: The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 
#Mc1-6: John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 
#Mc1-7: And this was his message: "After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 
#Mc1-8: I baptize you with "water, but he will baptize you with "the Holy Spirit." 
#Mc1-9: At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 
#Mc1-10: Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 
#Mc1-11: And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." 
#Mc1-12: At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, 
#Mc1-13: and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted "by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him. 
#Mc1-14: After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 
#Mc1-15: "The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!" 
#Mc1-16: As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 
#Mc1-17: "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people." 
#Mc1-18: At once they left their nets and followed him. 
#Mc1-19: When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. 
#Mc1-20: Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. 
#Mc1-21: They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. 
#Mc1-22: The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. 
#Mc1-23: Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, 
#Mc1-24: "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are —the Holy One of God!" 
#Mc1-25: "Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!" 
#Mc1-26: The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. 
#Mc1-27: The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching —and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him." 
#Mc1-28: News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. 
#Mc1-29: As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 
#Mc1-30: Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. 
#Mc1-31: So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. 
#Mc1-32: That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. 
#Mc1-33: The whole town gathered at the door, 
#Mc1-34: and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. 
#Mc1-35: Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. 
#Mc1-36: Simon and his companions went to look for him, 
#Mc1-37: and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!" 
#Mc1-38: Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else —to the nearby villages —so I can preach there also. That is why I have come." 
#Mc1-39: So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. 
#Mc1-40: A man with leprosy "came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." 
#Mc1-41: Jesus was indignant. "He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" 
#Mc1-42: Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. 
#Mc1-43: Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: 
#Mc1-44: "See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them." 
#Mc1-45: Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
 MARCOS 2
#Mc2-1: A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. 
#Mc2-2: They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. 
#Mc2-3: Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. 
#Mc2-4: Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. 
#Mc2-5: When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven." 
#Mc2-6: Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, 
#Mc2-7: "Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 
#Mc2-8: Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things? 
#Mc2-9: Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'? 
#Mc2-10: But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the man, 
#Mc2-11: "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home." 
#Mc2-12: He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" 
#Mc2-13: Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. 
#Mc2-14: As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him. 
#Mc2-15: While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. 
#Mc2-16: When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?" 
#Mc2-17: On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." 
#Mc2-18: Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?" 
#Mc2-19: Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. 
#Mc2-20: But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast. 
#Mc2-21: "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. 
#Mc2-22: And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." 
#Mc2-23: One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain. 
#Mc2-24: The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?" 
#Mc2-25: He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? 
#Mc2-26: In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions." 
#Mc2-27: Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 
#Mc2-28: So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
 MARCOS 3
#Mc3-1: Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. 
#Mc3-2: Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. 
#Mc3-3: Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone." 
#Mc3-4: Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent. 
#Mc3-5: He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. 
#Mc3-6: Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. 
#Mc3-7: Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. 
#Mc3-8: When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. 
#Mc3-9: Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him. 
#Mc3-10: For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him. 
#Mc3-11: Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God." 
#Mc3-12: But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him. 
#Mc3-13: Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. 
#Mc3-14: He appointed twelve "that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach 
#Mc3-15: and to have authority to drive out demons. 
#Mc3-16: These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter), 
#Mc3-17: James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder"), 
#Mc3-18: Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot 
#Mc3-19: and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. 
#Mc3-20: Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. 
#Mc3-21: When his family "heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind." 
#Mc3-22: And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons." 
#Mc3-23: So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan? 
#Mc3-24: If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 
#Mc3-25: If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 
#Mc3-26: And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. 
#Mc3-27: In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man's house. 
#Mc3-28: Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, 
#Mc3-29: but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin." 
#Mc3-30: He said this because they were saying, "He has an impure spirit." 
#Mc3-31: Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. 
#Mc3-32: A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you." 
#Mc3-33: "Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked. 
#Mc3-34: Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! 
#Mc3-35: Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."
 MARCOS 4
#Mc4-1: Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge. 
#Mc4-2: He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said: 
#Mc4-3: "Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. 
#Mc4-4: As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. 
#Mc4-5: Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 
#Mc4-6: But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 
#Mc4-7: Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. 
#Mc4-8: Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times." 
#Mc4-9: Then Jesus said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear." 
#Mc4-10: When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. 
#Mc4-11: He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables 
#Mc4-12: so that, "'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!' "" 
#Mc4-13: Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? 
#Mc4-14: The farmer sows the word. 
#Mc4-15: Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. 
#Mc4-16: Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. 
#Mc4-17: But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. 
#Mc4-18: Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; 
#Mc4-19: but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. 
#Mc4-20: Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop —some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown." 
#Mc4-21: He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand? 
#Mc4-22: For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. 
#Mc4-23: If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear." 
#Mc4-24: "Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you —and even more. 
#Mc4-25: Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them." 
#Mc4-26: He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. 
#Mc4-27: Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. 
#Mc4-28: All by itself the soil produces grain —first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. 
#Mc4-29: As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come." 
#Mc4-30: Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? 
#Mc4-31: It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth. 
#Mc4-32: Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade." 
#Mc4-33: With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. 
#Mc4-34: He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything. 
#Mc4-35: That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side." 
#Mc4-36: Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. 
#Mc4-37: A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. 
#Mc4-38: Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?" 
#Mc4-39: He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. 
#Mc4-40: He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?" 
#Mc4-41: They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"
 MARCOS 5
#Mc5-1: They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes. [^1] 
#Mc5-2: When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him. 
#Mc5-3: This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. 
#Mc5-4: For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. 
#Mc5-5: Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. 
#Mc5-6: When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. 
#Mc5-7: He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name don't torture me!" 
#Mc5-8: For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you impure spirit!" 
#Mc5-9: Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many." 
#Mc5-10: And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area. 
#Mc5-11: A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. 
#Mc5-12: The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them." 
#Mc5-13: He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. 
#Mc5-14: Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. 
#Mc5-15: When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 
#Mc5-16: Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man —and told about the pigs as well. 
#Mc5-17: Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region. 
#Mc5-18: As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. 
#Mc5-19: Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you." 
#Mc5-20: So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis "how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed. 
#Mc5-21: When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. 
#Mc5-22: Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. 
#Mc5-23: He pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live." 
#Mc5-24: So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him. 
#Mc5-25: And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. 
#Mc5-26: She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. 
#Mc5-27: When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, 
#Mc5-28: because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed." 
#Mc5-29: Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. 
#Mc5-30: At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?" 
#Mc5-31: "You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?' " 
#Mc5-32: But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. 
#Mc5-33: Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. 
#Mc5-34: He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering." 
#Mc5-35: While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher anymore?" 
#Mc5-36: Overhearing "what they said, Jesus told him, "Don't be afraid; just believe." 
#Mc5-37: He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. 
#Mc5-38: When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. 
#Mc5-39: He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep." 
#Mc5-40: But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. 
#Mc5-41: He took her by the hand and said to her, (which means "Little girl, I say to you, get up!" ). 
#Mc5-42: Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. 
#Mc5-43: He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
 MARCOS 6
#Mc6-1: Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. 
#Mc6-2: When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing? 
#Mc6-3: Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, "Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him. 
#Mc6-4: Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home." 
#Mc6-5: He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. 
#Mc6-6: He was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. 
#Mc6-7: Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits. 
#Mc6-8: These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff —no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. 
#Mc6-9: Wear sandals but not an extra shirt. 
#Mc6-10: Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. 
#Mc6-11: And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them." 
#Mc6-12: They went out and preached that people should repent. 
#Mc6-13: They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. 
#Mc6-14: King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, ""John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him." 
#Mc6-15: Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago." 
#Mc6-16: But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!" 
#Mc6-17: For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. 
#Mc6-18: For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." 
#Mc6-19: So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, 
#Mc6-20: because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled "; yet he liked to listen to him. 
#Mc6-21: Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. 
#Mc6-22: When the daughter of "Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you." 
#Mc6-23: And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom." 
#Mc6-24: She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered. 
#Mc6-25: At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter." 
#Mc6-26: The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. 
#Mc6-27: So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, 
#Mc6-28: and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. 
#Mc6-29: On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. 
#Mc6-30: The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. 
#Mc6-31: Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest." 
#Mc6-32: So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. 
#Mc6-33: But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. 
#Mc6-34: When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. 
#Mc6-35: By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late. 
#Mc6-36: Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat." 
#Mc6-37: But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take more than half a year's wages "! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?" 
#Mc6-38: "How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five —and two fish." 
#Mc6-39: Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. 
#Mc6-40: So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. 
#Mc6-41: Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. 
#Mc6-42: They all ate and were satisfied, 
#Mc6-43: and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. 
#Mc6-44: The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand. 
#Mc6-45: Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. 
#Mc6-46: After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray. 
#Mc6-47: Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. 
#Mc6-48: He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, 
#Mc6-49: but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, 
#Mc6-50: because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." 
#Mc6-51: Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, 
#Mc6-52: for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened. 
#Mc6-53: When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. 
#Mc6-54: As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. 
#Mc6-55: They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. 
#Mc6-56: And wherever he went —into villages, towns or countryside —they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
 MARCOS 7
#Mc7-1: The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus 
#Mc7-2: and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. 
#Mc7-3: (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. 
#Mc7-4: When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. ") 
#Mc7-5: So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?" 
#Mc7-6: He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. 
#Mc7-7: They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.' [^2] 
#Mc7-8: You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions." 
#Mc7-9: And he continued, "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe "your own traditions! 
#Mc7-10: For Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,' "and, 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.' [^5] 
#Mc7-11: But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God) — 
#Mc7-12: then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother. 
#Mc7-13: Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that." 
#Mc7-14: Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. 
#Mc7-15: Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them." 
#Mc7-16:  
#Mc7-17: After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 
#Mc7-18: "Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? 
#Mc7-19: For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.) 
#Mc7-20: He went on: "What comes out of a person is what defiles them. 
#Mc7-21: For it is from within, out of a person's heart, that evil thoughts come —sexual immorality, theft, murder, 
#Mc7-22: adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 
#Mc7-23: All these evils come from inside and defile a person." 
#Mc7-24: Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. "He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. 
#Mc7-25: In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet. 
#Mc7-26: The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. 
#Mc7-27: "First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs." 
#Mc7-28: "Lord," she replied, "even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." 
#Mc7-29: Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter." 
#Mc7-30: She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. 
#Mc7-31: Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. [^8] 
#Mc7-32: There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. 
#Mc7-33: After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. 
#Mc7-34: He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, (which means "Be opened!" ). 
#Mc7-35: At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. 
#Mc7-36: Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. 
#Mc7-37: People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."
 MARCOS 8
#Mc8-1: During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said, 
#Mc8-2: "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. 
#Mc8-3: If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance." 
#Mc8-4: His disciples answered, "But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?" 
#Mc8-5: "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied. 
#Mc8-6: He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so. 
#Mc8-7: They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them. 
#Mc8-8: The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 
#Mc8-9: About four thousand were present. After he had sent them away, 
#Mc8-10: he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha. 
#Mc8-11: The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven. 
#Mc8-12: He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to it." 
#Mc8-13: Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side. 
#Mc8-14: The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. 
#Mc8-15: "Be careful," Jesus warned them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod." 
#Mc8-16: They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread." 
#Mc8-17: Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened? 
#Mc8-18: Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember? 
#Mc8-19: When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" "Twelve," they replied. 
#Mc8-20: "And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven." 
#Mc8-21: He said to them, "Do you still not understand?" 
#Mc8-22: They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. 
#Mc8-23: He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?" 
#Mc8-24: He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around." 
#Mc8-25: Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. 
#Mc8-26: Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't even go into "the village." 
#Mc8-27: Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, "Who do people say I am?" 
#Mc8-28: They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets." 
#Mc8-29: "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Messiah." 
#Mc8-30: Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him. 
#Mc8-31: He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. 
#Mc8-32: He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 
#Mc8-33: But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns." 
#Mc8-34: Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. 
#Mc8-35: For whoever wants to save their life "will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. 
#Mc8-36: What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? 
#Mc8-37: Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? 
#Mc8-38: If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."
 MARCOS 9
#Mc9-1: And he said to them, "Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power." 
#Mc9-2: After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. 
#Mc9-3: His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. 
#Mc9-4: And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus. 
#Mc9-5: Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters —one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." 
#Mc9-6: (He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.) 
#Mc9-7: Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!" 
#Mc9-8: Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus. 
#Mc9-9: As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
#Mc9-10: They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant. 
#Mc9-11: And they asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?" 
#Mc9-12: Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected? 
#Mc9-13: But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him." 
#Mc9-14: When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. 
#Mc9-15: As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. 
#Mc9-16: "What are you arguing with them about?" he asked. 
#Mc9-17: A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. 
#Mc9-18: Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not." 
#Mc9-19: "You unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me." 
#Mc9-20: So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. 
#Mc9-21: Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" "From childhood," he answered. 
#Mc9-22: "It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us." 
#Mc9-23: "'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for one who believes." 
#Mc9-24: Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!" 
#Mc9-25: When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again." 
#Mc9-26: The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead." 
#Mc9-27: But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. 
#Mc9-28: After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?" 
#Mc9-29: He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer. "" 
#Mc9-30: They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, 
#Mc9-31: because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise." 
#Mc9-32: But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it. 
#Mc9-33: They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?" 
#Mc9-34: But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. 
#Mc9-35: Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all." 
#Mc9-36: He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, 
#Mc9-37: "Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me." 
#Mc9-38: "Teacher," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us." 
#Mc9-39: "Do not stop him," Jesus said. "For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, 
#Mc9-40: for whoever is not against us is for us. 
#Mc9-41: Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward. 
#Mc9-42: "If anyone causes one of these little ones —those who believe in me —to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea. 
#Mc9-43: If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. 
#Mc9-44:  
#Mc9-45: And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. 
#Mc9-46:  
#Mc9-47: And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, 
#Mc9-48: where "'the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.' [^4] 
#Mc9-49: Everyone will be salted with fire. 
#Mc9-50: "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other."
 MARCOS 10
#Mc10-1: Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. 
#Mc10-2: Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" 
#Mc10-3: "What did Moses command you?" he replied. 
#Mc10-4: They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away." 
#Mc10-5: "It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied. 
#Mc10-6: "But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' [^1] 
#Mc10-7: 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, [^2] 
#Mc10-8: and the two will become one flesh.' "So they are no longer two, but one flesh. 
#Mc10-9: Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." 
#Mc10-10: When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. 
#Mc10-11: He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. 
#Mc10-12: And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery." 
#Mc10-13: People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. 
#Mc10-14: When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 
#Mc10-15: Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." 
#Mc10-16: And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them. 
#Mc10-17: As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
#Mc10-18: "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good —except God alone. 
#Mc10-19: You know the commandments: 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.' "" 
#Mc10-20: "Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy." 
#Mc10-21: Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." 
#Mc10-22: At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. 
#Mc10-23: Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!" 
#Mc10-24: The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is "to enter the kingdom of God! 
#Mc10-25: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." 
#Mc10-26: The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?" 
#Mc10-27: Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God." 
#Mc10-28: Then Peter spoke up, "We have left everything to follow you!" 
#Mc10-29: "Truly I tell you," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel 
#Mc10-30: will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields —along with persecutions —and in the age to come eternal life. 
#Mc10-31: But many who are first will be last, and the last first." 
#Mc10-32: They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. 
#Mc10-33: "We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, 
#Mc10-34: who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise." 
#Mc10-35: Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask." 
#Mc10-36: "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked. 
#Mc10-37: They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory." 
#Mc10-38: "You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" 
#Mc10-39: "We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, 
#Mc10-40: but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared." 
#Mc10-41: When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. 
#Mc10-42: Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 
#Mc10-43: Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 
#Mc10-44: and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. 
#Mc10-45: For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." 
#Mc10-46: Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means "son of Timaeus"), was sitting by the roadside begging. 
#Mc10-47: When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" 
#Mc10-48: Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" 
#Mc10-49: Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you." 
#Mc10-50: Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. 
#Mc10-51: "What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see." 
#Mc10-52: "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.
 MARCOS 11
#Mc11-1: As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, 
#Mc11-2: saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. 
#Mc11-3: If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'" 
#Mc11-4: They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it, 
#Mc11-5: some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?" 
#Mc11-6: They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. 
#Mc11-7: When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. 
#Mc11-8: Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. 
#Mc11-9: Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! "" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" [^2] 
#Mc11-10: "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!" "Hosanna in the highest heaven!" 
#Mc11-11: Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. 
#Mc11-12: The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. 
#Mc11-13: Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. 
#Mc11-14: Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it. 
#Mc11-15: On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, 
#Mc11-16: and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. 
#Mc11-17: And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations' "? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.' "" 
#Mc11-18: The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. 
#Mc11-19: When evening came, Jesus and his disciples "went out of the city. 
#Mc11-20: In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. 
#Mc11-21: Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!" 
#Mc11-22: "Have faith in God," Jesus answered. 
#Mc11-23: "Truly "I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. 
#Mc11-24: Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. 
#Mc11-25: And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." 
#Mc11-26:  
#Mc11-27: They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him. 
#Mc11-28: "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?" 
#Mc11-29: Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 
#Mc11-30: John's baptism —was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!" 
#Mc11-31: They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' 
#Mc11-32: But if we say, 'Of human origin' â¦" (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.) 
#Mc11-33: So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
 MARCOS 12
#Mc12-1: Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. 
#Mc12-2: At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. 
#Mc12-3: But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 
#Mc12-4: Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. 
#Mc12-5: He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed. 
#Mc12-6: "He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.' 
#Mc12-7: "But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' 
#Mc12-8: So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. 
#Mc12-9: "What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. 
#Mc12-10: Haven't you read this passage of Scripture: "'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; 
#Mc12-11: the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes' "?" 
#Mc12-12: Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away. 
#Mc12-13: Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. 
#Mc12-14: They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax "to Caesar or not? 
#Mc12-15: Should we pay or shouldn't we?" But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked. "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it." 
#Mc12-16: They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose image is this? And whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied. 
#Mc12-17: Then Jesus said to them, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him. 
#Mc12-18: Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. 
#Mc12-19: "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. 
#Mc12-20: Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. 
#Mc12-21: The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. 
#Mc12-22: In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. 
#Mc12-23: At the resurrection "whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?" 
#Mc12-24: Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? 
#Mc12-25: When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. 
#Mc12-26: Now about the dead rising —have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' "? 
#Mc12-27: He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!" 
#Mc12-28: One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?" 
#Mc12-29: "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. [^5] 
#Mc12-30: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' [^6] 
#Mc12-31: The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' "There is no commandment greater than these." 
#Mc12-32: "Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. 
#Mc12-33: To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices." 
#Mc12-34: When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. 
#Mc12-35: While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David? 
#Mc12-36: David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."' [^8] 
#Mc12-37: David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight. 
#Mc12-38: As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, 
#Mc12-39: and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. 
#Mc12-40: They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely." 
#Mc12-41: Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. 
#Mc12-42: But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents. 
#Mc12-43: Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 
#Mc12-44: They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything —all she had to live on."
 MARCOS 13
#Mc13-1: As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!" 
#Mc13-2: "Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down." 
#Mc13-3: As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, 
#Mc13-4: "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?" 
#Mc13-5: Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you. 
#Mc13-6: Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many. 
#Mc13-7: When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 
#Mc13-8: Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains. 
#Mc13-9: "You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them. 
#Mc13-10: And the gospel must first be preached to all nations. 
#Mc13-11: Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. 
#Mc13-12: "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. 
#Mc13-13: Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 
#Mc13-14: "When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' "standing where it "does not belong —let the reader understand —then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 
#Mc13-15: Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out. 
#Mc13-16: Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. 
#Mc13-17: How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 
#Mc13-18: Pray that this will not take place in winter, 
#Mc13-19: because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now —and never to be equaled again. 
#Mc13-20: "If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them. 
#Mc13-21: At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. 
#Mc13-22: For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 
#Mc13-23: So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time. 
#Mc13-24: "But in those days, following that distress, "'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; 
#Mc13-25: the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' [^3] 
#Mc13-26: "At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 
#Mc13-27: And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens. 
#Mc13-28: "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. 
#Mc13-29: Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it "is near, right at the door. 
#Mc13-30: Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 
#Mc13-31: Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 
#Mc13-32: "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 
#Mc13-33: Be on guard! Be alert "! You do not know when that time will come. 
#Mc13-34: It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch. 
#Mc13-35: "Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back —whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn. 
#Mc13-36: If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. 
#Mc13-37: What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'"
 MARCOS 14
#Mc14-1: Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. 
#Mc14-2: "But not during the festival," they said, "or the people may riot." 
#Mc14-3: While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. 
#Mc14-4: Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume? 
#Mc14-5: It could have been sold for more than a year's wages "and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly. 
#Mc14-6: "Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. 
#Mc14-7: The poor you will always have with you, "and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. 
#Mc14-8: She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. 
#Mc14-9: Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her." 
#Mc14-10: Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. 
#Mc14-11: They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. 
#Mc14-12: On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?" 
#Mc14-13: So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. 
#Mc14-14: Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' 
#Mc14-15: He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there." 
#Mc14-16: The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. 
#Mc14-17: When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. 
#Mc14-18: While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me —one who is eating with me." 
#Mc14-19: They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely you don't mean me?" 
#Mc14-20: "It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me. 
#Mc14-21: The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born." 
#Mc14-22: While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body." 
#Mc14-23: Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 
#Mc14-24: "This is my blood of the "covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them. 
#Mc14-25: "Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God." 
#Mc14-26: When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
#Mc14-27: "You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' [^4] 
#Mc14-28: But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." 
#Mc14-29: Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not." 
#Mc14-30: "Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "today —yes, tonight —before the rooster crows twice "you yourself will disown me three times." 
#Mc14-31: But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same. 
#Mc14-32: They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray." 
#Mc14-33: He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. 
#Mc14-34: "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch." 
#Mc14-35: Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. 
#Mc14-36: , "Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will." 
#Mc14-37: Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Couldn't you keep watch for one hour? 
#Mc14-38: Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." 
#Mc14-39: Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. 
#Mc14-40: When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. 
#Mc14-41: Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners. 
#Mc14-42: Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!" 
#Mc14-43: Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. 
#Mc14-44: Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard." 
#Mc14-45: Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him. 
#Mc14-46: The men seized Jesus and arrested him. 
#Mc14-47: Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. 
#Mc14-48: "Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? 
#Mc14-49: Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled." 
#Mc14-50: Then everyone deserted him and fled. 
#Mc14-51: A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, 
#Mc14-52: he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. 
#Mc14-53: They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together. 
#Mc14-54: Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. 
#Mc14-55: The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. 
#Mc14-56: Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. 
#Mc14-57: Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: 
#Mc14-58: "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.'" 
#Mc14-59: Yet even then their testimony did not agree. 
#Mc14-60: Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?" 
#Mc14-61: But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?" 
#Mc14-62: "I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven." 
#Mc14-63: The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked. 
#Mc14-64: "You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death. 
#Mc14-65: Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him. 
#Mc14-66: While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. 
#Mc14-67: When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said. 
#Mc14-68: But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway. [^7] 
#Mc14-69: When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them." 
#Mc14-70: Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean." 
#Mc14-71: He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about." 
#Mc14-72: Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. "Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice "you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.
 MARCOS 15
#Mc15-1: Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, made their plans. So they bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate. 
#Mc15-2: "Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "You have said so," Jesus replied. 
#Mc15-3: The chief priests accused him of many things. 
#Mc15-4: So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of." 
#Mc15-5: But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. 
#Mc15-6: Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested. 
#Mc15-7: A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. 
#Mc15-8: The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. 
#Mc15-9: "Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate, 
#Mc15-10: knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. 
#Mc15-11: But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead. 
#Mc15-12: "What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them. 
#Mc15-13: "Crucify him!" they shouted. 
#Mc15-14: "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!" 
#Mc15-15: Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. 
#Mc15-16: The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. 
#Mc15-17: They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. 
#Mc15-18: And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!" 
#Mc15-19: Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. 
#Mc15-20: And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. 
#Mc15-21: A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. 
#Mc15-22: They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means "the place of the skull"). 
#Mc15-23: Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 
#Mc15-24: And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. 
#Mc15-25: It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. 
#Mc15-26: The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
#Mc15-27: They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left. 
#Mc15-28:  
#Mc15-29: Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, 
#Mc15-30: come down from the cross and save yourself!" 
#Mc15-31: In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! 
#Mc15-32: Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him. 
#Mc15-33: At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. 
#Mc15-34: And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, (which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" ). [^2] 
#Mc15-35: When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah." 
#Mc15-36: Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said. 
#Mc15-37: With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. 
#Mc15-38: The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 
#Mc15-39: And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, "he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!" 
#Mc15-40: Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, "and Salome. 
#Mc15-41: In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there. 
#Mc15-42: It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, 
#Mc15-43: Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. 
#Mc15-44: Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. 
#Mc15-45: When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. 
#Mc15-46: So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 
#Mc15-47: Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.
 MARCOS 16
#Mc16-1: When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body. 
#Mc16-2: Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb 
#Mc16-3: and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?" 
#Mc16-4: But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. 
#Mc16-5: As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. 
#Mc16-6: "Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. 
#Mc16-7: But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'" 
#Mc16-8: Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid. "[The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses 9â20.]
LUCAS
 LUCAS 1
#Lc1-1: Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled "among us, 
#Lc1-2: just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 
#Lc1-3: With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 
#Lc1-4: so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. 
#Lc1-5: In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. 
#Lc1-6: Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly. 
#Lc1-7: But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old. 
#Lc1-8: Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 
#Lc1-9: he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
#Lc1-10: And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside. 
#Lc1-11: Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 
#Lc1-12: When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. 
#Lc1-13: But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. 
#Lc1-14: He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, 
#Lc1-15: for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. 
#Lc1-16: He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. 
#Lc1-17: And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous —to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." 
#Lc1-18: Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years." 
#Lc1-19: The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. 
#Lc1-20: And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time." 
#Lc1-21: Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. 
#Lc1-22: When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. 
#Lc1-23: When his time of service was completed, he returned home. 
#Lc1-24: After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. 
#Lc1-25: "The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people." 
#Lc1-26: In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, 
#Lc1-27: to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. 
#Lc1-28: The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you." 
#Lc1-29: Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 
#Lc1-30: But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. 
#Lc1-31: You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. 
#Lc1-32: He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 
#Lc1-33: and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever; his kingdom will never end." 
#Lc1-34: "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?" 
#Lc1-35: The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called "the Son of God. 
#Lc1-36: Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. 
#Lc1-37: For no word from God will ever fail." 
#Lc1-38: "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May your word to me be fulfilled." Then the angel left her. 
#Lc1-39: At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, 
#Lc1-40: where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth. 
#Lc1-41: When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
#Lc1-42: In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! 
#Lc1-43: But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
#Lc1-44: As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 
#Lc1-45: Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!" 
#Lc1-46: And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord 
#Lc1-47: and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, 
#Lc1-48: for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed, 
#Lc1-49: for the Mighty One has done great things for me — holy is his name. 
#Lc1-50: His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation. 
#Lc1-51: He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. 
#Lc1-52: He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. 
#Lc1-53: He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty. 
#Lc1-54: He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful 
#Lc1-55: to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors." 
#Lc1-56: Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. 
#Lc1-57: When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. 
#Lc1-58: Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy. 
#Lc1-59: On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, 
#Lc1-60: but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John." 
#Lc1-61: They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name." 
#Lc1-62: Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. 
#Lc1-63: He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John." 
#Lc1-64: Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God. 
#Lc1-65: All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things. 
#Lc1-66: Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him. 
#Lc1-67: His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: 
#Lc1-68: "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and redeemed them. 
#Lc1-69: He has raised up a horn "of salvation for us in the house of his servant David 
#Lc1-70: (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago), 
#Lc1-71: salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us — 
#Lc1-72: to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant, 
#Lc1-73: the oath he swore to our father Abraham: 
#Lc1-74: to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear 
#Lc1-75: in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. 
#Lc1-76: And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, 
#Lc1-77: to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, 
#Lc1-78: because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven 
#Lc1-79: to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace." 
#Lc1-80: And the child grew and became strong in spirit "; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.
 LUCAS 2
#Lc2-1: In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 
#Lc2-2: (This was the first census that took place while "Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 
#Lc2-3: And everyone went to their own town to register. 
#Lc2-4: So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 
#Lc2-5: He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 
#Lc2-6: While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 
#Lc2-7: and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them. 
#Lc2-8: And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 
#Lc2-9: An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 
#Lc2-10: But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 
#Lc2-11: Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 
#Lc2-12: This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger." 
#Lc2-13: Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 
#Lc2-14: "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests." 
#Lc2-15: When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about." 
#Lc2-16: So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 
#Lc2-17: When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 
#Lc2-18: and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 
#Lc2-19: But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 
#Lc2-20: The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. 
#Lc2-21: On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived. 
#Lc2-22: When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord 
#Lc2-23: (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord" "), 
#Lc2-24: and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons." [^3] 
#Lc2-25: Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. 
#Lc2-26: It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah. 
#Lc2-27: Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, 
#Lc2-28: Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: 
#Lc2-29: "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss "your servant in peace. 
#Lc2-30: For my eyes have seen your salvation, 
#Lc2-31: which you have prepared in the sight of all nations: 
#Lc2-32: a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel." 
#Lc2-33: The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him. 
#Lc2-34: Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, 
#Lc2-35: so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too." 
#Lc2-36: There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, 
#Lc2-37: and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. "She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. 
#Lc2-38: Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. 
#Lc2-39: When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. 
#Lc2-40: And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him. 
#Lc2-41: Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. 
#Lc2-42: When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. 
#Lc2-43: After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. 
#Lc2-44: Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. 
#Lc2-45: When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. 
#Lc2-46: After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 
#Lc2-47: Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. 
#Lc2-48: When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you." 
#Lc2-49: "Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?" [^6] 
#Lc2-50: But they did not understand what he was saying to them. 
#Lc2-51: Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. 
#Lc2-52: And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.
 LUCAS 3
#Lc3-1: In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar —when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene — 
#Lc3-2: during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. 
#Lc3-3: He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 
#Lc3-4: As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. 
#Lc3-5: Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. 
#Lc3-6: And all people will see God's salvation.'" [^1] 
#Lc3-7: John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
#Lc3-8: Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
#Lc3-9: The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire." 
#Lc3-10: "What should we do then?" the crowd asked. 
#Lc3-11: John answered, "Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same." 
#Lc3-12: Even tax collectors came to be baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?" 
#Lc3-13: "Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them. 
#Lc3-14: Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely —be content with your pay." 
#Lc3-15: The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. 
#Lc3-16: John answered them all, "I baptize you with "water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with "the Holy Spirit and fire. 
#Lc3-17: His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." 
#Lc3-18: And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them. 
#Lc3-19: But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done, 
#Lc3-20: Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison. 
#Lc3-21: When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened 
#Lc3-22: and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." 
#Lc3-23: Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli, 
#Lc3-24: the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
#Lc3-25: the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 
#Lc3-26: the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josek, the son of Joda, 
#Lc3-27: the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 
#Lc3-28: the son of Melki, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
#Lc3-29: the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
#Lc3-30: the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
#Lc3-31: the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 
#Lc3-32: the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, "the son of Nahshon, 
#Lc3-33: the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, "the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
#Lc3-34: the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
#Lc3-35: the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 
#Lc3-36: the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
#Lc3-37: the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan, 
#Lc3-38: the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
 LUCAS 4
#Lc4-1: Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 
#Lc4-2: where for forty days he was tempted "by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry. 
#Lc4-3: The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread." 
#Lc4-4: Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone.' "" 
#Lc4-5: The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. 
#Lc4-6: And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. 
#Lc4-7: If you worship me, it will all be yours." 
#Lc4-8: Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.' "" 
#Lc4-9: The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here. 
#Lc4-10: For it is written: "'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; 
#Lc4-11: they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' "" 
#Lc4-12: Jesus answered, "It is said: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' "" 
#Lc4-13: When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time. 
#Lc4-14: Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. 
#Lc4-15: He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. 
#Lc4-16: He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, 
#Lc4-17: and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: 
#Lc4-18: "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, 
#Lc4-19: to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." [^6] 
#Lc4-20: Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. 
#Lc4-21: He began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing." 
#Lc4-22: All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked. 
#Lc4-23: Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!' And you will tell me, 'Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'" 
#Lc4-24: "Truly I tell you," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown. 
#Lc4-25: I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. 
#Lc4-26: Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. 
#Lc4-27: And there were many in Israel with leprosy "in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed —only Naaman the Syrian." 
#Lc4-28: All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. 
#Lc4-29: They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. 
#Lc4-30: But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way. 
#Lc4-31: Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. 
#Lc4-32: They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority. 
#Lc4-33: In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, 
#Lc4-34: "Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are —the Holy One of God!" 
#Lc4-35: "Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. 
#Lc4-36: All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!" 
#Lc4-37: And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. 
#Lc4-38: Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. 
#Lc4-39: So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them. 
#Lc4-40: At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. 
#Lc4-41: Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah. 
#Lc4-42: At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. 
#Lc4-43: But he said, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent." 
#Lc4-44: And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
 LUCAS 5
#Lc5-1: One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, "the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God. 
#Lc5-2: He saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. 
#Lc5-3: He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat. 
#Lc5-4: When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch." 
#Lc5-5: Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets." 
#Lc5-6: When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. 
#Lc5-7: So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. 
#Lc5-8: When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!" 
#Lc5-9: For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, 
#Lc5-10: and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will fish for people." 
#Lc5-11: So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him. 
#Lc5-12: While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. "When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." 
#Lc5-13: Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him. 
#Lc5-14: Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them." 
#Lc5-15: Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. 
#Lc5-16: But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. 
#Lc5-17: One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. 
#Lc5-18: Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. 
#Lc5-19: When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. 
#Lc5-20: When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven." 
#Lc5-21: The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 
#Lc5-22: Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? 
#Lc5-23: Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? 
#Lc5-24: But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home." 
#Lc5-25: Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. 
#Lc5-26: Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today." 
#Lc5-27: After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him, 
#Lc5-28: and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. 
#Lc5-29: Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. 
#Lc5-30: But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?" 
#Lc5-31: Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 
#Lc5-32: I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." 
#Lc5-33: They said to him, "John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking." 
#Lc5-34: Jesus answered, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? 
#Lc5-35: But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast." 
#Lc5-36: He told them this parable: "No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old. 
#Lc5-37: And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. 
#Lc5-38: No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. 
#Lc5-39: And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, 'The old is better.'"
 LUCAS 6
#Lc6-1: One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. 
#Lc6-2: Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?" 
#Lc6-3: Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 
#Lc6-4: He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions." 
#Lc6-5: Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." 
#Lc6-6: On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. 
#Lc6-7: The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. 
#Lc6-8: But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there. 
#Lc6-9: Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?" 
#Lc6-10: He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored. 
#Lc6-11: But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. 
#Lc6-12: One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. 
#Lc6-13: When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: 
#Lc6-14: Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 
#Lc6-15: Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, 
#Lc6-16: Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. 
#Lc6-17: He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, 
#Lc6-18: who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, 
#Lc6-19: and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all. 
#Lc6-20: Looking at his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. 
#Lc6-21: Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. 
#Lc6-22: Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man. 
#Lc6-23: "Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets. 
#Lc6-24: "But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort. 
#Lc6-25: Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. 
#Lc6-26: Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets. 
#Lc6-27: "But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 
#Lc6-28: bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 
#Lc6-29: If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. 
#Lc6-30: Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 
#Lc6-31: Do to others as you would have them do to you. 
#Lc6-32: "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. 
#Lc6-33: And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. 
#Lc6-34: And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. 
#Lc6-35: But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 
#Lc6-36: Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. 
#Lc6-37: "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. 
#Lc6-38: Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." 
#Lc6-39: He also told them this parable: "Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? 
#Lc6-40: The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher. 
#Lc6-41: "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 
#Lc6-42: How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. 
#Lc6-43: "No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. 
#Lc6-44: Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. 
#Lc6-45: A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. 
#Lc6-46: "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? 
#Lc6-47: As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. 
#Lc6-48: They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. 
#Lc6-49: But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete."
 LUCAS 7
#Lc7-1: When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum. 
#Lc7-2: There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. 
#Lc7-3: The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. 
#Lc7-4: When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this, 
#Lc7-5: because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue." 
#Lc7-6: So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. 
#Lc7-7: That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
#Lc7-8: For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." 
#Lc7-9: When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel." 
#Lc7-10: Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. 
#Lc7-11: Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. 
#Lc7-12: As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out —the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. 
#Lc7-13: When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry." 
#Lc7-14: Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!" 
#Lc7-15: The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. 
#Lc7-16: They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people." 
#Lc7-17: This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. 
#Lc7-18: John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, 
#Lc7-19: he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?" 
#Lc7-20: When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'" 
#Lc7-21: At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. 
#Lc7-22: So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy "are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. 
#Lc7-23: Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me." 
#Lc7-24: After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind? 
#Lc7-25: If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. 
#Lc7-26: But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 
#Lc7-27: This is the one about whom it is written: "'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' [^2] 
#Lc7-28: I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he." 
#Lc7-29: (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. 
#Lc7-30: But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) 
#Lc7-31: Jesus went on to say, "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? 
#Lc7-32: They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: "'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.' 
#Lc7-33: For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' 
#Lc7-34: The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' 
#Lc7-35: But wisdom is proved right by all her children." 
#Lc7-36: When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. 
#Lc7-37: A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. 
#Lc7-38: As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. 
#Lc7-39: When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is —that she is a sinner." 
#Lc7-40: Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said. 
#Lc7-41: "Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, "and the other fifty. 
#Lc7-42: Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?" 
#Lc7-43: Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said. 
#Lc7-44: Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 
#Lc7-45: You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. 
#Lc7-46: You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. 
#Lc7-47: Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven —as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little." 
#Lc7-48: Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven." 
#Lc7-49: The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?" 
#Lc7-50: Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
 LUCAS 8
#Lc8-1: After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, 
#Lc8-2: and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; 
#Lc8-3: Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. 
#Lc8-4: While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: 
#Lc8-5: "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. 
#Lc8-6: Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. 
#Lc8-7: Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. 
#Lc8-8: Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear." 
#Lc8-9: His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 
#Lc8-10: He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, "'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' [^1] 
#Lc8-11: "This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. 
#Lc8-12: Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. 
#Lc8-13: Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. 
#Lc8-14: The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. 
#Lc8-15: But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. 
#Lc8-16: "No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. 
#Lc8-17: For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. 
#Lc8-18: Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them." 
#Lc8-19: Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. 
#Lc8-20: Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you." 
#Lc8-21: He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice." 
#Lc8-22: One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out. 
#Lc8-23: As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. 
#Lc8-24: The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. 
#Lc8-25: "Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him." 
#Lc8-26: They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, "which is across the lake from Galilee. 
#Lc8-27: When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. 
#Lc8-28: When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!" 
#Lc8-29: For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. 
#Lc8-30: Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him. 
#Lc8-31: And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. 
#Lc8-32: A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. 
#Lc8-33: When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. 
#Lc8-34: When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, 
#Lc8-35: and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 
#Lc8-36: Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. 
#Lc8-37: Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. 
#Lc8-38: The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
#Lc8-39: "Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. 
#Lc8-40: Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. 
#Lc8-41: Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house 
#Lc8-42: because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. 
#Lc8-43: And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, "but no one could heal her. 
#Lc8-44: She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. 
#Lc8-45: "Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you." 
#Lc8-46: But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me." 
#Lc8-47: Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. 
#Lc8-48: Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace." 
#Lc8-49: While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher anymore." 
#Lc8-50: Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed." 
#Lc8-51: When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother. 
#Lc8-52: Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep." 
#Lc8-53: They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. 
#Lc8-54: But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!" 
#Lc8-55: Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. 
#Lc8-56: Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
 LUCAS 9
#Lc9-1: When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, 
#Lc9-2: and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 
#Lc9-3: He told them: "Take nothing for the journey —no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt. 
#Lc9-4: Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. 
#Lc9-5: If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them." 
#Lc9-6: So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere. 
#Lc9-7: Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, 
#Lc9-8: others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. 
#Lc9-9: But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him. 
#Lc9-10: When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, 
#Lc9-11: but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing. 
#Lc9-12: Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here." 
#Lc9-13: He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish —unless we go and buy food for all this crowd." 
#Lc9-14: (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each." 
#Lc9-15: The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. 
#Lc9-16: Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. 
#Lc9-17: They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 
#Lc9-18: Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?" 
#Lc9-19: They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life." 
#Lc9-20: "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "God's Messiah." 
#Lc9-21: Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. 
#Lc9-22: And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life." 
#Lc9-23: Then he said to them all: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. 
#Lc9-24: For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it. 
#Lc9-25: What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self? 
#Lc9-26: Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. 
#Lc9-27: "Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God." 
#Lc9-28: About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. 
#Lc9-29: As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. 
#Lc9-30: Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. 
#Lc9-31: They spoke about his departure, "which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. 
#Lc9-32: Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. 
#Lc9-33: As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters —one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.) 
#Lc9-34: While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 
#Lc9-35: A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him." 
#Lc9-36: When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen. 
#Lc9-37: The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. 
#Lc9-38: A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. 
#Lc9-39: A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. 
#Lc9-40: I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not." 
#Lc9-41: "You unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here." 
#Lc9-42: Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. 
#Lc9-43: And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, 
#Lc9-44: "Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men." 
#Lc9-45: But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it. 
#Lc9-46: An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. 
#Lc9-47: Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. 
#Lc9-48: Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest." 
#Lc9-49: "Master," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us." 
#Lc9-50: "Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you." 
#Lc9-51: As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. 
#Lc9-52: And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; 
#Lc9-53: but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. 
#Lc9-54: When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them "?" 
#Lc9-55: But Jesus turned and rebuked them. 
#Lc9-56: Then he and his disciples went to another village. 
#Lc9-57: As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go." 
#Lc9-58: Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." 
#Lc9-59: He said to another man, "Follow me." But he replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father." 
#Lc9-60: Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God." 
#Lc9-61: Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family." 
#Lc9-62: Jesus replied, "No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."
 LUCAS 10
#Lc10-1: After this the Lord appointed seventy-two "others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. 
#Lc10-2: He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. 
#Lc10-3: Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. 
#Lc10-4: Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road. 
#Lc10-5: "When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.' 
#Lc10-6: If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. 
#Lc10-7: Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. 
#Lc10-8: "When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. 
#Lc10-9: Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' 
#Lc10-10: But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 
#Lc10-11: 'Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.' 
#Lc10-12: I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. 
#Lc10-13: "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 
#Lc10-14: But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. 
#Lc10-15: And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. [^2] 
#Lc10-16: "Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me." 
#Lc10-17: The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name." 
#Lc10-18: He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 
#Lc10-19: I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 
#Lc10-20: However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven." 
#Lc10-21: At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. 
#Lc10-22: "All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him." 
#Lc10-23: Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. 
#Lc10-24: For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it." 
#Lc10-25: On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
#Lc10-26: "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?" 
#Lc10-27: He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind' "; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' "" 
#Lc10-28: "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live." 
#Lc10-29: But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" 
#Lc10-30: In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 
#Lc10-31: A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 
#Lc10-32: So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 
#Lc10-33: But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 
#Lc10-34: He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. 
#Lc10-35: The next day he took out two denarii "and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' 
#Lc10-36: "Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?" 
#Lc10-37: The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise." 
#Lc10-38: As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. 
#Lc10-39: She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said. 
#Lc10-40: But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!" 
#Lc10-41: "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things, 
#Lc10-42: but few things are needed —or indeed only one. "Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."
 LUCAS 11
#Lc11-1: One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples." 
#Lc11-2: He said to them, "When you pray, say: "'Father, "hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. [^2] 
#Lc11-3: Give us each day our daily bread. 
#Lc11-4: Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. "And lead us not into temptation. "'" 
#Lc11-5: Then Jesus said to them, "Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; 
#Lc11-6: a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.' 
#Lc11-7: And suppose the one inside answers, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.' 
#Lc11-8: I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity "he will surely get up and give you as much as you need. 
#Lc11-9: "So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 
#Lc11-10: For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. 
#Lc11-11: "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for "a fish, will give him a snake instead? 
#Lc11-12: Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 
#Lc11-13: If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!" 
#Lc11-14: Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. 
#Lc11-15: But some of them said, "By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons." 
#Lc11-16: Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven. 
#Lc11-17: Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. 
#Lc11-18: If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. 
#Lc11-19: Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. 
#Lc11-20: But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 
#Lc11-21: "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe. 
#Lc11-22: But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder. 
#Lc11-23: "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. 
#Lc11-24: "When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' 
#Lc11-25: When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. 
#Lc11-26: Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first." 
#Lc11-27: As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you." 
#Lc11-28: He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it." 
#Lc11-29: As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. 
#Lc11-30: For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. 
#Lc11-31: The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here. 
#Lc11-32: The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something greater than Jonah is here. 
#Lc11-33: "No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light. 
#Lc11-34: Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, "your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, "your body also is full of darkness. 
#Lc11-35: See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. 
#Lc11-36: Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you." 
#Lc11-37: When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. 
#Lc11-38: But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal. 
#Lc11-39: Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. 
#Lc11-40: You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? 
#Lc11-41: But now as for what is inside you —be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you. 
#Lc11-42: "Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone. 
#Lc11-43: "Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces. 
#Lc11-44: "Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it." 
#Lc11-45: One of the experts in the law answered him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also." 
#Lc11-46: Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them. 
#Lc11-47: "Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them. 
#Lc11-48: So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. 
#Lc11-49: Because of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.' 
#Lc11-50: Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, 
#Lc11-51: from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all. 
#Lc11-52: "Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering." 
#Lc11-53: When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, 
#Lc11-54: waiting to catch him in something he might say.
 LUCAS 12
#Lc12-1: Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: "Be "on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 
#Lc12-2: There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. 
#Lc12-3: What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs. 
#Lc12-4: "I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. 
#Lc12-5: But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. 
#Lc12-6: Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. 
#Lc12-7: Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 
#Lc12-8: "I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God. 
#Lc12-9: But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God. 
#Lc12-10: And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. 
#Lc12-11: "When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, 
#Lc12-12: for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say." 
#Lc12-13: Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me." 
#Lc12-14: Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?" 
#Lc12-15: Then he said to them, "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions." 
#Lc12-16: And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 
#Lc12-17: He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.' 
#Lc12-18: "Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 
#Lc12-19: And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry."' 
#Lc12-20: "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?' 
#Lc12-21: "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God." 
#Lc12-22: Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. 
#Lc12-23: For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. 
#Lc12-24: Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! 
#Lc12-25: Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life "? 
#Lc12-26: Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest? 
#Lc12-27: "Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 
#Lc12-28: If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you —you of little faith! 
#Lc12-29: And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. 
#Lc12-30: For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. 
#Lc12-31: But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. 
#Lc12-32: "Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. 
#Lc12-33: Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. 
#Lc12-34: For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 
#Lc12-35: "Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, 
#Lc12-36: like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. 
#Lc12-37: It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. 
#Lc12-38: It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. 
#Lc12-39: But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. 
#Lc12-40: You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him." 
#Lc12-41: Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?" 
#Lc12-42: The Lord answered, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? 
#Lc12-43: It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. 
#Lc12-44: Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 
#Lc12-45: But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk. 
#Lc12-46: The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers. 
#Lc12-47: "The servant who knows the master's will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. 
#Lc12-48: But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. 
#Lc12-49: "I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! 
#Lc12-50: But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed! 
#Lc12-51: Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. 
#Lc12-52: From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. 
#Lc12-53: They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law." 
#Lc12-54: He said to the crowd: "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does. 
#Lc12-55: And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is. 
#Lc12-56: Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don't know how to interpret this present time? 
#Lc12-57: "Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right? 
#Lc12-58: As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. 
#Lc12-59: I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny."
 LUCAS 13
#Lc13-1: Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 
#Lc13-2: Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? 
#Lc13-3: I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. 
#Lc13-4: Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them —do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? 
#Lc13-5: I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish." 
#Lc13-6: Then he told this parable: "A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. 
#Lc13-7: So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?' 
#Lc13-8: "'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it. 
#Lc13-9: If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'" 
#Lc13-10: On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, 
#Lc13-11: and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. 
#Lc13-12: When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity." 
#Lc13-13: Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God. 
#Lc13-14: Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath." 
#Lc13-15: The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? 
#Lc13-16: Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?" 
#Lc13-17: When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing. 
#Lc13-18: Then Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? 
#Lc13-19: It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches." 
#Lc13-20: Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? 
#Lc13-21: It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds "of flour until it worked all through the dough." 
#Lc13-22: Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. 
#Lc13-23: Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them, 
#Lc13-24: "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to. 
#Lc13-25: Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.' "But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.' 
#Lc13-26: "Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.' 
#Lc13-27: "But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!' 
#Lc13-28: "There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. 
#Lc13-29: People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God. 
#Lc13-30: Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last." 
#Lc13-31: At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you." 
#Lc13-32: He replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.' 
#Lc13-33: In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day —for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem! 
#Lc13-34: "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. 
#Lc13-35: Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' ""
 LUCAS 14
#Lc14-1: One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. 
#Lc14-2: There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. 
#Lc14-3: Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?" 
#Lc14-4: But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way. 
#Lc14-5: Then he asked them, "If one of you has a child "or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?" 
#Lc14-6: And they had nothing to say. 
#Lc14-7: When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: 
#Lc14-8: "When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. 
#Lc14-9: If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, 'Give this person your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. 
#Lc14-10: But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests. 
#Lc14-11: For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted." 
#Lc14-12: Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid. 
#Lc14-13: But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, 
#Lc14-14: and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous." 
#Lc14-15: When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God." 
#Lc14-16: Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. 
#Lc14-17: At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.' 
#Lc14-18: "But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, 'I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.' 
#Lc14-19: "Another said, 'I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.' 
#Lc14-20: "Still another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.' 
#Lc14-21: "The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.' 
#Lc14-22: "'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.' 
#Lc14-23: "Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. 
#Lc14-24: I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'" 
#Lc14-25: Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: 
#Lc14-26: "If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters —yes, even their own life —such a person cannot be my disciple. 
#Lc14-27: And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. 
#Lc14-28: "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? 
#Lc14-29: For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, 
#Lc14-30: saying, 'This person began to build and wasn't able to finish.' 
#Lc14-31: "Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won't he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? 
#Lc14-32: If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. 
#Lc14-33: In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples. 
#Lc14-34: "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? 
#Lc14-35: It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."
 LUCAS 15
#Lc15-1: Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. 
#Lc15-2: But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them." 
#Lc15-3: Then Jesus told them this parable: 
#Lc15-4: "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? 
#Lc15-5: And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders 
#Lc15-6: and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.' 
#Lc15-7: I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent. 
#Lc15-8: "Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins "and loses one. Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? 
#Lc15-9: And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.' 
#Lc15-10: In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents." 
#Lc15-11: Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons. 
#Lc15-12: The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them. 
#Lc15-13: "Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. 
#Lc15-14: After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. 
#Lc15-15: So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. 
#Lc15-16: He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. 
#Lc15-17: "When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! 
#Lc15-18: I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. 
#Lc15-19: I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.' 
#Lc15-20: So he got up and went to his father. "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. 
#Lc15-21: "The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' 
#Lc15-22: "But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. 
#Lc15-23: Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. 
#Lc15-24: For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate. 
#Lc15-25: "Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 
#Lc15-26: So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 
#Lc15-27: 'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.' 
#Lc15-28: "The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. 
#Lc15-29: But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. 
#Lc15-30: But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!' 
#Lc15-31: "'My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 
#Lc15-32: But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'"
 LUCAS 16
#Lc16-1: Jesus told his disciples: "There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. 
#Lc16-2: So he called him in and asked him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.' 
#Lc16-3: "The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg — 
#Lc16-4: I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.' 
#Lc16-5: "So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' 
#Lc16-6: "'Nine hundred gallons "of olive oil,' he replied. "The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.' 
#Lc16-7: "Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?' "'A thousand bushels "of wheat,' he replied. "He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight hundred.' 
#Lc16-8: "The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. 
#Lc16-9: I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. 
#Lc16-10: "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. 
#Lc16-11: So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? 
#Lc16-12: And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own? 
#Lc16-13: "No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money." 
#Lc16-14: The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. 
#Lc16-15: He said to them, "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God's sight. 
#Lc16-16: "The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it. 
#Lc16-17: It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. 
#Lc16-18: "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 
#Lc16-19: "There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 
#Lc16-20: At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 
#Lc16-21: and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. 
#Lc16-22: "The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 
#Lc16-23: In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 
#Lc16-24: So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' 
#Lc16-25: "But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 
#Lc16-26: And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.' 
#Lc16-27: "He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 
#Lc16-28: for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' 
#Lc16-29: "Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' 
#Lc16-30: "'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' 
#Lc16-31: "He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'"
 LUCAS 17
#Lc17-1: Jesus said to his disciples: "Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. 
#Lc17-2: It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. 
#Lc17-3: So watch yourselves. "If your brother or sister "sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. 
#Lc17-4: Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying 'I repent,' you must forgive them." 
#Lc17-5: The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!" 
#Lc17-6: He replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you. 
#Lc17-7: "Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'? 
#Lc17-8: Won't he rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'? 
#Lc17-9: Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? 
#Lc17-10: So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'" 
#Lc17-11: Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. 
#Lc17-12: As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy "met him. They stood at a distance 
#Lc17-13: and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!" 
#Lc17-14: When he saw them, he said, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were cleansed. 
#Lc17-15: One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. 
#Lc17-16: He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him —and he was a Samaritan. 
#Lc17-17: Jesus asked, "Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? 
#Lc17-18: Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?" 
#Lc17-19: Then he said to him, "Rise and go; your faith has made you well." 
#Lc17-20: Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, 
#Lc17-21: nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is in your midst." [^3] 
#Lc17-22: Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. 
#Lc17-23: People will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here he is!' Do not go running off after them. 
#Lc17-24: For the Son of Man in his day "will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. 
#Lc17-25: But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. 
#Lc17-26: "Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. 
#Lc17-27: People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. 
#Lc17-28: "It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. 
#Lc17-29: But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. 
#Lc17-30: "It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. 
#Lc17-31: On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. 
#Lc17-32: Remember Lot's wife! 
#Lc17-33: Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it. 
#Lc17-34: I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. 
#Lc17-35: Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left." 
#Lc17-36:  
#Lc17-37: "Where, Lord?" they asked. He replied, "Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather."
 LUCAS 18
#Lc18-1: Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. 
#Lc18-2: He said: "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. 
#Lc18-3: And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.' 
#Lc18-4: "For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people think, 
#Lc18-5: yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!'" 
#Lc18-6: And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says. 
#Lc18-7: And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? 
#Lc18-8: I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?" 
#Lc18-9: To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: 
#Lc18-10: "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 
#Lc18-11: The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people —robbers, evildoers, adulterers —or even like this tax collector. 
#Lc18-12: I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.' 
#Lc18-13: "But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.' 
#Lc18-14: "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted." 
#Lc18-15: People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. 
#Lc18-16: But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 
#Lc18-17: Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." 
#Lc18-18: A certain ruler asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
#Lc18-19: "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good —except God alone. 
#Lc18-20: You know the commandments: 'You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.' "" 
#Lc18-21: "All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said. 
#Lc18-22: When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." 
#Lc18-23: When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. 
#Lc18-24: Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! 
#Lc18-25: Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." 
#Lc18-26: Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?" 
#Lc18-27: Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God." 
#Lc18-28: Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!" 
#Lc18-29: "Truly I tell you," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God 
#Lc18-30: will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life." 
#Lc18-31: Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. 
#Lc18-32: He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him; 
#Lc18-33: they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again." 
#Lc18-34: The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about. 
#Lc18-35: As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. 
#Lc18-36: When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. 
#Lc18-37: They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by." 
#Lc18-38: He called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" 
#Lc18-39: Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" 
#Lc18-40: Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, 
#Lc18-41: "What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord, I want to see," he replied. 
#Lc18-42: Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you." 
#Lc18-43: Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.
 LUCAS 19
#Lc19-1: Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. 
#Lc19-2: A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. 
#Lc19-3: He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. 
#Lc19-4: So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. 
#Lc19-5: When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today." 
#Lc19-6: So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly. 
#Lc19-7: All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a sinner." 
#Lc19-8: But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount." 
#Lc19-9: Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. 
#Lc19-10: For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost." 
#Lc19-11: While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. 
#Lc19-12: He said: "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. 
#Lc19-13: So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. "'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.' 
#Lc19-14: "But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.' 
#Lc19-15: "He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it. 
#Lc19-16: "The first one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned ten more.' 
#Lc19-17: "'Well done, my good servant!' his master replied. 'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.' 
#Lc19-18: "The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five more.' 
#Lc19-19: "His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.' 
#Lc19-20: "Then another servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. 
#Lc19-21: I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.' 
#Lc19-22: "His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow? 
#Lc19-23: Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?' 
#Lc19-24: "Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.' 
#Lc19-25: "'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!' 
#Lc19-26: "He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away. 
#Lc19-27: But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them —bring them here and kill them in front of me.'" 
#Lc19-28: After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. 
#Lc19-29: As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, 
#Lc19-30: "Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. 
#Lc19-31: If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord needs it.'" 
#Lc19-32: Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. 
#Lc19-33: As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?" 
#Lc19-34: They replied, "The Lord needs it." 
#Lc19-35: They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it. 
#Lc19-36: As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road. 
#Lc19-37: When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen: 
#Lc19-38: "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!" ""Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!" 
#Lc19-39: Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!" 
#Lc19-40: "I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out." 
#Lc19-41: As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it 
#Lc19-42: and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace —but now it is hidden from your eyes. 
#Lc19-43: The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. 
#Lc19-44: They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you." 
#Lc19-45: When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. 
#Lc19-46: "It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be a house of prayer' "; but you have made it 'a den of robbers.' "" 
#Lc19-47: Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. 
#Lc19-48: Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.
 LUCAS 20
#Lc20-1: One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. 
#Lc20-2: "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?" 
#Lc20-3: He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me, 
#Lc20-4: John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men?" 
#Lc20-5: They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?' 
#Lc20-6: But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet." 
#Lc20-7: So they answered, "We don't know where it was from." 
#Lc20-8: Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things." 
#Lc20-9: He went on to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time. 
#Lc20-10: At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 
#Lc20-11: He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed. 
#Lc20-12: He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out. 
#Lc20-13: "Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.' 
#Lc20-14: "But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. 'This is the heir,' they said. 'Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' 
#Lc20-15: So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 
#Lc20-16: "What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When the people heard this, they said, "May this never be!" 
#Lc20-17: Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: "'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone '? 
#Lc20-18: Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed." 
#Lc20-19: The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. 
#Lc20-20: Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. 
#Lc20-21: So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. 
#Lc20-22: Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?" 
#Lc20-23: He saw through their duplicity and said to them, 
#Lc20-24: "Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?" 
#Lc20-25: "Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." 
#Lc20-26: They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent. 
#Lc20-27: Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. 
#Lc20-28: "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. 
#Lc20-29: Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. 
#Lc20-30: The second 
#Lc20-31: and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. 
#Lc20-32: Finally, the woman died too. 
#Lc20-33: Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?" 
#Lc20-34: Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. 
#Lc20-35: But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, 
#Lc20-36: and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection. 
#Lc20-37: But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' 
#Lc20-38: He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive." 
#Lc20-39: Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!" 
#Lc20-40: And no one dared to ask him any more questions. 
#Lc20-41: Then Jesus said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David? 
#Lc20-42: David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand 
#Lc20-43: until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."' 
#Lc20-44: David calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" 
#Lc20-45: While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, 
#Lc20-46: "Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. 
#Lc20-47: They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."
 LUCAS 21
#Lc21-1: As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. 
#Lc21-2: He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. 
#Lc21-3: "Truly I tell you," he said, "this poor widow has put in more than all the others. 
#Lc21-4: All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on." 
#Lc21-5: Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said, 
#Lc21-6: "As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down." 
#Lc21-7: "Teacher," they asked, "when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?" 
#Lc21-8: He replied: "Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them. 
#Lc21-9: When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away." 
#Lc21-10: Then he said to them: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 
#Lc21-11: There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. 
#Lc21-12: "But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. 
#Lc21-13: And so you will bear testimony to me. 
#Lc21-14: But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. 
#Lc21-15: For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. 
#Lc21-16: You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. 
#Lc21-17: Everyone will hate you because of me. 
#Lc21-18: But not a hair of your head will perish. 
#Lc21-19: Stand firm, and you will win life. 
#Lc21-20: "When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. 
#Lc21-21: Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city. 
#Lc21-22: For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written. 
#Lc21-23: How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. 
#Lc21-24: They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. 
#Lc21-25: "There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. 
#Lc21-26: People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. 
#Lc21-27: At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
#Lc21-28: When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near." 
#Lc21-29: He told them this parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees. 
#Lc21-30: When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. 
#Lc21-31: Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near. 
#Lc21-32: "Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 
#Lc21-33: Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 
#Lc21-34: "Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap. 
#Lc21-35: For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth. 
#Lc21-36: Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man." 
#Lc21-37: Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, 
#Lc21-38: and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
 LUCAS 22
#Lc22-1: Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, 
#Lc22-2: and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. 
#Lc22-3: Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. 
#Lc22-4: And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. 
#Lc22-5: They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 
#Lc22-6: He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present. 
#Lc22-7: Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 
#Lc22-8: Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover." 
#Lc22-9: "Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked. 
#Lc22-10: He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, 
#Lc22-11: and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' 
#Lc22-12: He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there." 
#Lc22-13: They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. 
#Lc22-14: When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. 
#Lc22-15: And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 
#Lc22-16: For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God." 
#Lc22-17: After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you. 
#Lc22-18: For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes." 
#Lc22-19: And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me." 
#Lc22-20: In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. [^1] 
#Lc22-21: But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. 
#Lc22-22: The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!" 
#Lc22-23: They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this. 
#Lc22-24: A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. 
#Lc22-25: Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. 
#Lc22-26: But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. 
#Lc22-27: For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. 
#Lc22-28: You are those who have stood by me in my trials. 
#Lc22-29: And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, 
#Lc22-30: so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
#Lc22-31: "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. 
#Lc22-32: But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers." 
#Lc22-33: But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death." 
#Lc22-34: Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me." 
#Lc22-35: Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" "Nothing," they answered. 
#Lc22-36: He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. 
#Lc22-37: It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors' "; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." 
#Lc22-38: The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords." "That's enough!" he replied. 
#Lc22-39: Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. 
#Lc22-40: On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation." 
#Lc22-41: He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, 
#Lc22-42: "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done." 
#Lc22-43: An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. 
#Lc22-44: And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. [^3] 
#Lc22-45: When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. 
#Lc22-46: "Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation." 
#Lc22-47: While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, 
#Lc22-48: but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" 
#Lc22-49: When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?" 
#Lc22-50: And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. 
#Lc22-51: But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him. 
#Lc22-52: Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs? 
#Lc22-53: Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour —when darkness reigns." 
#Lc22-54: Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. 
#Lc22-55: And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. 
#Lc22-56: A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him." 
#Lc22-57: But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said. 
#Lc22-58: A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied. 
#Lc22-59: About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean." 
#Lc22-60: Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. 
#Lc22-61: The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times." 
#Lc22-62: And he went outside and wept bitterly. 
#Lc22-63: The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. 
#Lc22-64: They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?" 
#Lc22-65: And they said many other insulting things to him. 
#Lc22-66: At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. 
#Lc22-67: "If you are the Messiah," they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me, 
#Lc22-68: and if I asked you, you would not answer. 
#Lc22-69: But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God." 
#Lc22-70: They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You say that I am." 
#Lc22-71: Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."
 LUCAS 23
#Lc23-1: Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. 
#Lc23-2: And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king." 
#Lc23-3: So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "You have said so," Jesus replied. 
#Lc23-4: Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man." 
#Lc23-5: But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here." 
#Lc23-6: On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. 
#Lc23-7: When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. 
#Lc23-8: When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort. 
#Lc23-9: He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. 
#Lc23-10: The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. 
#Lc23-11: Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. 
#Lc23-12: That day Herod and Pilate became friends —before this they had been enemies. 
#Lc23-13: Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, 
#Lc23-14: and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. 
#Lc23-15: Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. 
#Lc23-16: Therefore, I will punish him and then release him." 
#Lc23-17:  
#Lc23-18: But the whole crowd shouted, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!" 
#Lc23-19: (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.) 
#Lc23-20: Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. 
#Lc23-21: But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" 
#Lc23-22: For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him." 
#Lc23-23: But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed. 
#Lc23-24: So Pilate decided to grant their demand. 
#Lc23-25: He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will. 
#Lc23-26: As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. 
#Lc23-27: A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. 
#Lc23-28: Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children. 
#Lc23-29: For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' 
#Lc23-30: Then "'they will say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!"' [^2] 
#Lc23-31: For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?" 
#Lc23-32: Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. 
#Lc23-33: When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals —one on his right, the other on his left. 
#Lc23-34: Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." "And they divided up his clothes by casting lots. 
#Lc23-35: The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is God's Messiah, the Chosen One." 
#Lc23-36: The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar 
#Lc23-37: and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself." 
#Lc23-38: There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
#Lc23-39: One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!" 
#Lc23-40: But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence? 
#Lc23-41: We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong." 
#Lc23-42: Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. "" 
#Lc23-43: Jesus answered him, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise." 
#Lc23-44: It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, 
#Lc23-45: for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. 
#Lc23-46: Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." "When he had said this, he breathed his last. 
#Lc23-47: The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man." 
#Lc23-48: When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. 
#Lc23-49: But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things. 
#Lc23-50: Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, 
#Lc23-51: who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. 
#Lc23-52: Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body. 
#Lc23-53: Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. 
#Lc23-54: It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. 
#Lc23-55: The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. 
#Lc23-56: Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
 LUCAS 24
#Lc24-1: On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. 
#Lc24-2: They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 
#Lc24-3: but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
#Lc24-4: While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. 
#Lc24-5: In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead? 
#Lc24-6: He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 
#Lc24-7: 'The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.' " 
#Lc24-8: Then they remembered his words. 
#Lc24-9: When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. 
#Lc24-10: It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. 
#Lc24-11: But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. 
#Lc24-12: Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. 
#Lc24-13: Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles "from Jerusalem. 
#Lc24-14: They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. 
#Lc24-15: As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; 
#Lc24-16: but they were kept from recognizing him. 
#Lc24-17: He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast. 
#Lc24-18: One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?" 
#Lc24-19: "What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. 
#Lc24-20: The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; 
#Lc24-21: but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. 
#Lc24-22: In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning 
#Lc24-23: but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. 
#Lc24-24: Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus." 
#Lc24-25: He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 
#Lc24-26: Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?" 
#Lc24-27: And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. 
#Lc24-28: As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. 
#Lc24-29: But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them. 
#Lc24-30: When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 
#Lc24-31: Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 
#Lc24-32: They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?" 
#Lc24-33: They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 
#Lc24-34: and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon." 
#Lc24-35: Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. 
#Lc24-36: While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." 
#Lc24-37: They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 
#Lc24-38: He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? 
#Lc24-39: Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have." 
#Lc24-40: When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. 
#Lc24-41: And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?" 
#Lc24-42: They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 
#Lc24-43: and he took it and ate it in their presence. 
#Lc24-44: He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms." 
#Lc24-45: Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. 
#Lc24-46: He told them, "This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, 
#Lc24-47: and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 
#Lc24-48: You are witnesses of these things. 
#Lc24-49: I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high." 
#Lc24-50: When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 
#Lc24-51: While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. 
#Lc24-52: Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. 
#Lc24-53: And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.

 JOÃO 1
#Jo1-1: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
#Jo1-2: He was with God in the beginning. 
#Jo1-3: Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 
#Jo1-4: In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 
#Jo1-5: The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome "it. 
#Jo1-6: There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 
#Jo1-7: He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 
#Jo1-8: He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. 
#Jo1-9: The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. 
#Jo1-10: He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 
#Jo1-11: He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 
#Jo1-12: Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God — 
#Jo1-13: children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. 
#Jo1-14: The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. 
#Jo1-15: (John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, "This is the one I spoke about when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'") 
#Jo1-16: Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. 
#Jo1-17: For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
#Jo1-18: No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and "is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known. 
#Jo1-19: Now this was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders "in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. 
#Jo1-20: He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Messiah." 
#Jo1-21: They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No." 
#Jo1-22: Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?" 
#Jo1-23: John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'" [^4] 
#Jo1-24: Now the Pharisees who had been sent 
#Jo1-25: questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?" 
#Jo1-26: "I baptize with "water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know. 
#Jo1-27: He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie." 
#Jo1-28: This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
#Jo1-29: The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 
#Jo1-30: This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' 
#Jo1-31: I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel." 
#Jo1-32: Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. 
#Jo1-33: And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' 
#Jo1-34: I have seen and I testify that this is God's Chosen One." [^6] 
#Jo1-35: The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. 
#Jo1-36: When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!" 
#Jo1-37: When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. 
#Jo1-38: Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"), "where are you staying?" 
#Jo1-39: "Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon. 
#Jo1-40: Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. 
#Jo1-41: The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ). 
#Jo1-42: And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter "). 
#Jo1-43: The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me." 
#Jo1-44: Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. 
#Jo1-45: Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote —Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." 
#Jo1-46: "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip. 
#Jo1-47: When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit." 
#Jo1-48: "How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you." 
#Jo1-49: Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel." 
#Jo1-50: Jesus said, "You believe "because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that." 
#Jo1-51: He then added, "Very truly I tell you, "you "will see 'heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on' "the Son of Man."
 JOÃO 2
#Jo2-1: On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, 
#Jo2-2: and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 
#Jo2-3: When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine." 
#Jo2-4: "Woman, "why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My hour has not yet come." 
#Jo2-5: His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you." 
#Jo2-6: Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. [^2] 
#Jo2-7: Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water" ; so they filled them to the brim. 
#Jo2-8: Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so, 
#Jo2-9: and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 
#Jo2-10: and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now." 
#Jo2-11: What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. 
#Jo2-12: After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days. 
#Jo2-13: When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
#Jo2-14: In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. 
#Jo2-15: So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 
#Jo2-16: To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a market!" 
#Jo2-17: His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me." [^3] 
#Jo2-18: The Jews then responded to him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?" 
#Jo2-19: Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days." 
#Jo2-20: They replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?" 
#Jo2-21: But the temple he had spoken of was his body. 
#Jo2-22: After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken. 
#Jo2-23: Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name. [^4] 
#Jo2-24: But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. 
#Jo2-25: He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.
 JOÃO 3
#Jo3-1: Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. 
#Jo3-2: He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him." 
#Jo3-3: Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again. "" 
#Jo3-4: "How can someone be born when they are old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born!" 
#Jo3-5: Jesus answered, "Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 
#Jo3-6: Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit "gives birth to spirit. 
#Jo3-7: You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You "must be born again.' 
#Jo3-8: The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit." [^4] 
#Jo3-9: "How can this be?" Nicodemus asked. 
#Jo3-10: "You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things? 
#Jo3-11: Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 
#Jo3-12: I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 
#Jo3-13: No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven —the Son of Man. [^5] 
#Jo3-14: Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, [^6] 
#Jo3-15: that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him." [^7] 
#Jo3-16: For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 
#Jo3-17: For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 
#Jo3-18: Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. 
#Jo3-19: This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 
#Jo3-20: Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 
#Jo3-21: But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God. 
#Jo3-22: After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. 
#Jo3-23: Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. 
#Jo3-24: (This was before John was put in prison.) 
#Jo3-25: An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. 
#Jo3-26: They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan —the one you testified about —look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him." 
#Jo3-27: To this John replied, "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. 
#Jo3-28: You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.' 
#Jo3-29: The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. 
#Jo3-30: He must become greater; I must become less." [^8] 
#Jo3-31: The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. 
#Jo3-32: He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. 
#Jo3-33: Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. 
#Jo3-34: For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God "gives the Spirit without limit. 
#Jo3-35: The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. 
#Jo3-36: Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them.
 JOÃO 4
#Jo4-1: Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John — 
#Jo4-2: although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. 
#Jo4-3: So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. 
#Jo4-4: Now he had to go through Samaria. 
#Jo4-5: So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 
#Jo4-6: Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon. 
#Jo4-7: When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?" 
#Jo4-8: (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) 
#Jo4-9: The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ") 
#Jo4-10: Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water." 
#Jo4-11: "Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? 
#Jo4-12: Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?" 
#Jo4-13: Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, 
#Jo4-14: but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life." 
#Jo4-15: The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water." 
#Jo4-16: He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back." 
#Jo4-17: "I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband. 
#Jo4-18: The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true." 
#Jo4-19: "Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet. 
#Jo4-20: Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem." 
#Jo4-21: "Woman," Jesus replied, "believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 
#Jo4-22: You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. 
#Jo4-23: Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. 
#Jo4-24: God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth." 
#Jo4-25: The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us." 
#Jo4-26: Then Jesus declared, "I, the one speaking to you —I am he." 
#Jo4-27: Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?" 
#Jo4-28: Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, 
#Jo4-29: "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?" 
#Jo4-30: They came out of the town and made their way toward him. 
#Jo4-31: Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something." 
#Jo4-32: But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about." 
#Jo4-33: Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?" 
#Jo4-34: "My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. 
#Jo4-35: Don't you have a saying, 'It's still four months until harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. 
#Jo4-36: Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. 
#Jo4-37: Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. 
#Jo4-38: I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor." 
#Jo4-39: Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did." 
#Jo4-40: So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. 
#Jo4-41: And because of his words many more became believers. 
#Jo4-42: They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world." 
#Jo4-43: After the two days he left for Galilee. 
#Jo4-44: (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) 
#Jo4-45: When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there. 
#Jo4-46: Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. 
#Jo4-47: When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. 
#Jo4-48: "Unless you people see signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe." 
#Jo4-49: The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies." 
#Jo4-50: "Go," Jesus replied, "your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed. 
#Jo4-51: While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. 
#Jo4-52: When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him." 
#Jo4-53: Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and his whole household believed. 
#Jo4-54: This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
 JOÃO 5
#Jo5-1: Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. 
#Jo5-2: Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda "and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. 
#Jo5-3: Here a great number of disabled people used to lie —the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. 
#Jo5-4:  
#Jo5-5: One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 
#Jo5-6: When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?" 
#Jo5-7: "Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me." 
#Jo5-8: Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk." 
#Jo5-9: At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, 
#Jo5-10: and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat." 
#Jo5-11: But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.' " 
#Jo5-12: So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?" 
#Jo5-13: The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. 
#Jo5-14: Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you." 
#Jo5-15: The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well. 
#Jo5-16: So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. 
#Jo5-17: In his defense Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working." 
#Jo5-18: For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. 
#Jo5-19: Jesus gave them this answer: "Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. 
#Jo5-20: For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed. 
#Jo5-21: For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. 
#Jo5-22: Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, 
#Jo5-23: that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. 
#Jo5-24: "Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. 
#Jo5-25: Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. 
#Jo5-26: For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. 
#Jo5-27: And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. 
#Jo5-28: "Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice 
#Jo5-29: and come out —those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned. 
#Jo5-30: By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. 
#Jo5-31: "If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. 
#Jo5-32: There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true. 
#Jo5-33: "You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. 
#Jo5-34: Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. 
#Jo5-35: John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. 
#Jo5-36: "I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish —the very works that I am doing —testify that the Father has sent me. 
#Jo5-37: And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, 
#Jo5-38: nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. 
#Jo5-39: You study "the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, 
#Jo5-40: yet you refuse to come to me to have life. 
#Jo5-41: "I do not accept glory from human beings, 
#Jo5-42: but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. 
#Jo5-43: I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him. 
#Jo5-44: How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God "? 
#Jo5-45: "But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. 
#Jo5-46: If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. 
#Jo5-47: But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?"
 JOÃO 6
#Jo6-1: Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), 
#Jo6-2: and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick. 
#Jo6-3: Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. 
#Jo6-4: The Jewish Passover Festival was near. 
#Jo6-5: When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?" 
#Jo6-6: He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. 
#Jo6-7: Philip answered him, "It would take more than half a year's wages "to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!" 
#Jo6-8: Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, 
#Jo6-9: "Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?" 
#Jo6-10: Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there). 
#Jo6-11: Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. 
#Jo6-12: When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted." 
#Jo6-13: So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. 
#Jo6-14: After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world." 
#Jo6-15: Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. 
#Jo6-16: When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, 
#Jo6-17: where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. 
#Jo6-18: A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. 
#Jo6-19: When they had rowed about three or four miles, "they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were frightened. 
#Jo6-20: But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid." 
#Jo6-21: Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. 
#Jo6-22: The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. 
#Jo6-23: Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 
#Jo6-24: Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. 
#Jo6-25: When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?" 
#Jo6-26: Jesus answered, "Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. 
#Jo6-27: Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval." 
#Jo6-28: Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?" 
#Jo6-29: Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent." 
#Jo6-30: So they asked him, "What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? 
#Jo6-31: Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' "" 
#Jo6-32: Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. 
#Jo6-33: For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world." 
#Jo6-34: "Sir," they said, "always give us this bread." 
#Jo6-35: Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 
#Jo6-36: But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. 
#Jo6-37: All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. 
#Jo6-38: For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 
#Jo6-39: And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 
#Jo6-40: For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day." 
#Jo6-41: At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven." 
#Jo6-42: They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven' ?" 
#Jo6-43: "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered. 
#Jo6-44: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. 
#Jo6-45: It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' "Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. 
#Jo6-46: No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. 
#Jo6-47: Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. 
#Jo6-48: I am the bread of life. 
#Jo6-49: Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. 
#Jo6-50: But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. 
#Jo6-51: I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." 
#Jo6-52: Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" 
#Jo6-53: Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. 
#Jo6-54: Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. 
#Jo6-55: For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. 
#Jo6-56: Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. 
#Jo6-57: Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. 
#Jo6-58: This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever." 
#Jo6-59: He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. 
#Jo6-60: On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?" 
#Jo6-61: Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you? 
#Jo6-62: Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! 
#Jo6-63: The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you —they are full of the Spirit "and life. 
#Jo6-64: Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. 
#Jo6-65: He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them." 
#Jo6-66: From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. 
#Jo6-67: "You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve. 
#Jo6-68: Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 
#Jo6-69: We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God." 
#Jo6-70: Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!" 
#Jo6-71: (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)
 JOÃO 7
#Jo7-1: After this, Jesus went around in Galilee. He did not want "to go about in Judea because the Jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him. 
#Jo7-2: But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, 
#Jo7-3: Jesus' brothers said to him, "Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may see the works you do. 
#Jo7-4: No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world." 
#Jo7-5: For even his own brothers did not believe in him. 
#Jo7-6: Therefore Jesus told them, "My time is not yet here; for you any time will do. 
#Jo7-7: The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil. 
#Jo7-8: You go to the festival. I am not "going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come." 
#Jo7-9: After he had said this, he stayed in Galilee. 
#Jo7-10: However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in secret. 
#Jo7-11: Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking, "Where is he?" 
#Jo7-12: Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people." 
#Jo7-13: But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders. 
#Jo7-14: Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach. 
#Jo7-15: The Jews there were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having been taught?" 
#Jo7-16: Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. 
#Jo7-17: Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. 
#Jo7-18: Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. 
#Jo7-19: Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?" 
#Jo7-20: "You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?" 
#Jo7-21: Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. 
#Jo7-22: Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath. 
#Jo7-23: Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man's whole body on the Sabbath? 
#Jo7-24: Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly." 
#Jo7-25: At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? 
#Jo7-26: Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah? 
#Jo7-27: But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from." 
#Jo7-28: Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, 
#Jo7-29: but I know him because I am from him and he sent me." 
#Jo7-30: At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. 
#Jo7-31: Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, "When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?" 
#Jo7-32: The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him. 
#Jo7-33: Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me. 
#Jo7-34: You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come." 
#Jo7-35: The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 
#Jo7-36: What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come' ?" 
#Jo7-37: On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. 
#Jo7-38: Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them." [^3] 
#Jo7-39: By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified. 
#Jo7-40: On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet." 
#Jo7-41: Others said, "He is the Messiah." Still others asked, "How can the Messiah come from Galilee? 
#Jo7-42: Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?" 
#Jo7-43: Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. 
#Jo7-44: Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him. 
#Jo7-45: Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?" 
#Jo7-46: "No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards replied. 
#Jo7-47: "You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted. 
#Jo7-48: "Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? 
#Jo7-49: No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law —there is a curse on them." 
#Jo7-50: Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, 
#Jo7-51: "Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?" 
#Jo7-52: They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee." [The earliest manuscripts and many other ancient witnesses do not have John 7:53 —8:11. A few manuscripts include these verses, wholly or in part, after John 7:36, John 21:25, Luke 21:38 or Luke 24:53.]

#Jo8-12: When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." 
#Jo8-13: The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid." 
#Jo8-14: Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. 
#Jo8-15: You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. 
#Jo8-16: But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. 
#Jo8-17: In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true. 
#Jo8-18: I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me." 
#Jo8-19: Then they asked him, "Where is your father?" "You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also." 
#Jo8-20: He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come. 
#Jo8-21: Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come." 
#Jo8-22: This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come' ?" 
#Jo8-23: But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. 
#Jo8-24: I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins." 
#Jo8-25: "Who are you?" they asked. "Just what I have been telling you from the beginning," Jesus replied. 
#Jo8-26: "I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world." 
#Jo8-27: They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. 
#Jo8-28: So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up "the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. 
#Jo8-29: The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him." 
#Jo8-30: Even as he spoke, many believed in him. 
#Jo8-31: To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. 
#Jo8-32: Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." 
#Jo8-33: They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?" 
#Jo8-34: Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. 
#Jo8-35: Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. 
#Jo8-36: So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. 
#Jo8-37: I know that you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word. 
#Jo8-38: I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father. "" 
#Jo8-39: "Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would "do what Abraham did. 
#Jo8-40: As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. 
#Jo8-41: You are doing the works of your own father." "We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself." 
#Jo8-42: Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. 
#Jo8-43: Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. 
#Jo8-44: You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 
#Jo8-45: Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! 
#Jo8-46: Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? 
#Jo8-47: Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God." 
#Jo8-48: The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?" 
#Jo8-49: "I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. 
#Jo8-50: I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. 
#Jo8-51: Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death." 
#Jo8-52: At this they exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. 
#Jo8-53: Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?" 
#Jo8-54: Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. 
#Jo8-55: Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word. 
#Jo8-56: Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad." 
#Jo8-57: "You are not yet fifty years old," they said to him, "and you have seen Abraham!" 
#Jo8-58: "Very truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!" 
#Jo8-59: At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
 JOÃO 9
#Jo9-1: As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. 
#Jo9-2: His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?" 
#Jo9-3: "Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him. 
#Jo9-4: As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work. 
#Jo9-5: While I am in the world, I am the light of the world." 
#Jo9-6: After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. 
#Jo9-7: "Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam" (this word means "Sent"). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing. 
#Jo9-8: His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?" 
#Jo9-9: Some claimed that he was. Others said, "No, he only looks like him." But he himself insisted, "I am the man." 
#Jo9-10: "How then were your eyes opened?" they asked. 
#Jo9-11: He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see." 
#Jo9-12: "Where is this man?" they asked him. "I don't know," he said. 
#Jo9-13: They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. 
#Jo9-14: Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath. 
#Jo9-15: Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see." 
#Jo9-16: Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner perform such signs?" So they were divided. 
#Jo9-17: Then they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened." The man replied, "He is a prophet." 
#Jo9-18: They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. 
#Jo9-19: "Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?" 
#Jo9-20: "We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind. 
#Jo9-21: But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself." 
#Jo9-22: His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. 
#Jo9-23: That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him." 
#Jo9-24: A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God by telling the truth," they said. "We know this man is a sinner." 
#Jo9-25: He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!" 
#Jo9-26: Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?" 
#Jo9-27: He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?" 
#Jo9-28: Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! 
#Jo9-29: We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from." 
#Jo9-30: The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. 
#Jo9-31: We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. 
#Jo9-32: Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. 
#Jo9-33: If this man were not from God, he could do nothing." 
#Jo9-34: To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out. 
#Jo9-35: Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" 
#Jo9-36: "Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him." 
#Jo9-37: Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you." 
#Jo9-38: Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him. 
#Jo9-39: Jesus said, ""For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind." 
#Jo9-40: Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?" 
#Jo9-41: Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.
 JOÃO 10
#Jo10-1: "Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. 
#Jo10-2: The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. 
#Jo10-3: The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 
#Jo10-4: When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. 
#Jo10-5: But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice." 
#Jo10-6: Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them. 
#Jo10-7: Therefore Jesus said again, "Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. 
#Jo10-8: All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them. 
#Jo10-9: I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. "They will come in and go out, and find pasture. 
#Jo10-10: The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. 
#Jo10-11: "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 
#Jo10-12: The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. 
#Jo10-13: The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. 
#Jo10-14: "I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me — 
#Jo10-15: just as the Father knows me and I know the Father —and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
#Jo10-16: I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. 
#Jo10-17: The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life —only to take it up again. 
#Jo10-18: No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father." 
#Jo10-19: The Jews who heard these words were again divided. 
#Jo10-20: Many of them said, "He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?" 
#Jo10-21: But others said, "These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?" 
#Jo10-22: Then came the Festival of Dedication "at Jerusalem. It was winter, 
#Jo10-23: and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade. 
#Jo10-24: The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly." 
#Jo10-25: Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify about me, 
#Jo10-26: but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. 
#Jo10-27: My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. 
#Jo10-28: I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. 
#Jo10-29: My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all "; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. 
#Jo10-30: I and the Father are one." 
#Jo10-31: Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him, 
#Jo10-32: but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?" 
#Jo10-33: "We are not stoning you for any good work," they replied, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God." 
#Jo10-34: Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are "gods"' "? 
#Jo10-35: If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came —and Scripture cannot be set aside — 
#Jo10-36: what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? 
#Jo10-37: Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father. 
#Jo10-38: But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father." 
#Jo10-39: Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp. 
#Jo10-40: Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed, 
#Jo10-41: and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true." 
#Jo10-42: And in that place many believed in Jesus.
 JOÃO 11
#Jo11-1: Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
#Jo11-2: (This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) 
#Jo11-3: So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick." 
#Jo11-4: When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it." 
#Jo11-5: Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
#Jo11-6: So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days, 
#Jo11-7: and then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea." 
#Jo11-8: "But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you, and yet you are going back?" 
#Jo11-9: Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world's light. 
#Jo11-10: It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light." 
#Jo11-11: After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up." 
#Jo11-12: His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better." 
#Jo11-13: Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. 
#Jo11-14: So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead, 
#Jo11-15: and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him." 
#Jo11-16: Then Thomas (also known as Didymus ") said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him." 
#Jo11-17: On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. 
#Jo11-18: Now Bethany was less than two miles "from Jerusalem, 
#Jo11-19: and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. 
#Jo11-20: When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. 
#Jo11-21: "Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
#Jo11-22: But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask." 
#Jo11-23: Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again." 
#Jo11-24: Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day." 
#Jo11-25: Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; 
#Jo11-26: and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?" 
#Jo11-27: "Yes, Lord," she replied, "I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world." 
#Jo11-28: After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you." 
#Jo11-29: When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. 
#Jo11-30: Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. 
#Jo11-31: When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. 
#Jo11-32: When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." 
#Jo11-33: When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. 
#Jo11-34: "Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied. 
#Jo11-35: Jesus wept. 
#Jo11-36: Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!" 
#Jo11-37: But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?" 
#Jo11-38: Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. 
#Jo11-39: "Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days." 
#Jo11-40: Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?" 
#Jo11-41: So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me. 
#Jo11-42: I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me." 
#Jo11-43: When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!" 
#Jo11-44: The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go." 
#Jo11-45: Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. 
#Jo11-46: But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 
#Jo11-47: Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many signs. 
#Jo11-48: If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation." 
#Jo11-49: Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all! 
#Jo11-50: You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish." 
#Jo11-51: He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 
#Jo11-52: and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 
#Jo11-53: So from that day on they plotted to take his life. 
#Jo11-54: Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. 
#Jo11-55: When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. 
#Jo11-56: They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the festival at all?" 
#Jo11-57: But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.
 JOÃO 12
#Jo12-1: Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 
#Jo12-2: Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. 
#Jo12-3: Then Mary took about a pint "of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 
#Jo12-4: But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, 
#Jo12-5: "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. "" 
#Jo12-6: He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. 
#Jo12-7: "Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. 
#Jo12-8: You will always have the poor among you, "but you will not always have me." 
#Jo12-9: Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 
#Jo12-10: So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, 
#Jo12-11: for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him. 
#Jo12-12: The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. 
#Jo12-13: They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! "" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" ""Blessed is the king of Israel!" 
#Jo12-14: Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written: 
#Jo12-15: "Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt." [^6] 
#Jo12-16: At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him. 
#Jo12-17: Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. 
#Jo12-18: Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him. 
#Jo12-19: So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!" 
#Jo12-20: Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. 
#Jo12-21: They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus." 
#Jo12-22: Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. 
#Jo12-23: Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 
#Jo12-24: Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. 
#Jo12-25: Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 
#Jo12-26: Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. 
#Jo12-27: "Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. 
#Jo12-28: Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again." 
#Jo12-29: The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. 
#Jo12-30: Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine. 
#Jo12-31: Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. 
#Jo12-32: And I, when I am lifted up "from the earth, will draw all people to myself." 
#Jo12-33: He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. 
#Jo12-34: The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up' ? Who is this 'Son of Man'?" 
#Jo12-35: Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going. 
#Jo12-36: Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. 
#Jo12-37: Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. 
#Jo12-38: This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" [^8] 
#Jo12-39: For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: 
#Jo12-40: "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn —and I would heal them." [^9] 
#Jo12-41: Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. 
#Jo12-42: Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; 
#Jo12-43: for they loved human praise more than praise from God. 
#Jo12-44: Then Jesus cried out, "Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. 
#Jo12-45: The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me. 
#Jo12-46: I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. 
#Jo12-47: "If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. 
#Jo12-48: There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day. 
#Jo12-49: For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken. 
#Jo12-50: I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."
 JOÃO 13
#Jo13-1: It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. 
#Jo13-2: The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. 
#Jo13-3: Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; 
#Jo13-4: so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. 
#Jo13-5: After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. 
#Jo13-6: He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?" 
#Jo13-7: Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand." 
#Jo13-8: "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." 
#Jo13-9: "Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!" 
#Jo13-10: Jesus answered, "Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." 
#Jo13-11: For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. 
#Jo13-12: When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them. 
#Jo13-13: "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. 
#Jo13-14: Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. 
#Jo13-15: I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. 
#Jo13-16: Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. 
#Jo13-17: Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. 
#Jo13-18: "I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: 'He who shared my bread has turned "against me.' [^2] 
#Jo13-19: "I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am. 
#Jo13-20: Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me." 
#Jo13-21: After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, "Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me." 
#Jo13-22: His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. 
#Jo13-23: One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. 
#Jo13-24: Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means." 
#Jo13-25: Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?" 
#Jo13-26: Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. 
#Jo13-27: As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. So Jesus told him, "What you are about to do, do quickly." 
#Jo13-28: But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. 
#Jo13-29: Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor. 
#Jo13-30: As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night. 
#Jo13-31: When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him. 
#Jo13-32: If God is glorified in him, "God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. 
#Jo13-33: "My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. 
#Jo13-34: "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 
#Jo13-35: By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another." 
#Jo13-36: Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later." 
#Jo13-37: Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you." 
#Jo13-38: Then Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!
 JOÃO 14
#Jo14-1: "Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God "; believe also in me. 
#Jo14-2: My Father's house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 
#Jo14-3: And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. 
#Jo14-4: You know the way to the place where I am going." 
#Jo14-5: Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" 
#Jo14-6: Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 
#Jo14-7: If you really know me, you will know "my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." 
#Jo14-8: Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us." 
#Jo14-9: Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 
#Jo14-10: Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 
#Jo14-11: Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves. 
#Jo14-12: Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 
#Jo14-13: And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
#Jo14-14: You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. 
#Jo14-15: "If you love me, keep my commands. 
#Jo14-16: And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever — 
#Jo14-17: the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be "in you. 
#Jo14-18: I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 
#Jo14-19: Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. 
#Jo14-20: On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. 
#Jo14-21: Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them." 
#Jo14-22: Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?" 
#Jo14-23: Jesus replied, "Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. 
#Jo14-24: Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. 
#Jo14-25: "All this I have spoken while still with you. 
#Jo14-26: But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. 
#Jo14-27: Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid. 
#Jo14-28: "You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. 
#Jo14-29: I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe. 
#Jo14-30: I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me, 
#Jo14-31: but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. "Come now; let us leave.
 JOÃO 15
#Jo15-1: "I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. 
#Jo15-2: He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes "so that it will be even more fruitful. 
#Jo15-3: You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. 
#Jo15-4: Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. 
#Jo15-5: "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. 
#Jo15-6: If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. 
#Jo15-7: If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 
#Jo15-8: This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. 
#Jo15-9: "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. 
#Jo15-10: If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in his love. 
#Jo15-11: I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. 
#Jo15-12: My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. 
#Jo15-13: Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends. 
#Jo15-14: You are my friends if you do what I command. 
#Jo15-15: I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. 
#Jo15-16: You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit —fruit that will last —and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. 
#Jo15-17: This is my command: Love each other. 
#Jo15-18: "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. 
#Jo15-19: If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. 
#Jo15-20: Remember what I told you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' "If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. 
#Jo15-21: They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me. 
#Jo15-22: If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. 
#Jo15-23: Whoever hates me hates my Father as well. 
#Jo15-24: If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. 
#Jo15-25: But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.' [^3] 
#Jo15-26: "When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father —the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father —he will testify about me. 
#Jo15-27: And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.
 JOÃO 16
#Jo16-1: "All this I have told you so that you will not fall away. 
#Jo16-2: They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. 
#Jo16-3: They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. 
#Jo16-4: I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you, 
#Jo16-5: but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' 
#Jo16-6: Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things. 
#Jo16-7: But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 
#Jo16-8: When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: 
#Jo16-9: about sin, because people do not believe in me; 
#Jo16-10: about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; 
#Jo16-11: and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned. 
#Jo16-12: "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. 
#Jo16-13: But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. 
#Jo16-14: He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you. 
#Jo16-15: All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you." 
#Jo16-16: Jesus went on to say, "In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me." 
#Jo16-17: At this, some of his disciples said to one another, "What does he mean by saying, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,' and 'Because I am going to the Father' ?" 
#Jo16-18: They kept asking, "What does he mean by 'a little while' ? We don't understand what he is saying." 
#Jo16-19: Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, "Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me'? 
#Jo16-20: Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. 
#Jo16-21: A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. 
#Jo16-22: So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. 
#Jo16-23: In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. 
#Jo16-24: Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete. 
#Jo16-25: "Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. 
#Jo16-26: In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. 
#Jo16-27: No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. 
#Jo16-28: I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father." 
#Jo16-29: Then Jesus' disciples said, "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. 
#Jo16-30: Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God." 
#Jo16-31: "Do you now believe?" Jesus replied. 
#Jo16-32: "A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me. 
#Jo16-33: "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."
 JOÃO 17
#Jo17-1: After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. 
#Jo17-2: For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. 
#Jo17-3: Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. 
#Jo17-4: I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. 
#Jo17-5: And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began. 
#Jo17-6: "I have revealed you "to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word. 
#Jo17-7: Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you. 
#Jo17-8: For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. 
#Jo17-9: I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours. 
#Jo17-10: All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. 
#Jo17-11: I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of "your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one. 
#Jo17-12: While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by "that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled. 
#Jo17-13: "I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. 
#Jo17-14: I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. 
#Jo17-15: My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. 
#Jo17-16: They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. 
#Jo17-17: Sanctify them by "the truth; your word is truth. 
#Jo17-18: As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. 
#Jo17-19: For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. 
#Jo17-20: "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, 
#Jo17-21: that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 
#Jo17-22: I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one — 
#Jo17-23: I in them and you in me —so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. 
#Jo17-24: "Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. 
#Jo17-25: "Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. 
#Jo17-26: I have made you "known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."
 JOÃO 18
#Jo18-1: When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it. 
#Jo18-2: Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. 
#Jo18-3: So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons. 
#Jo18-4: Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?" 
#Jo18-5: "Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) 
#Jo18-6: When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground. 
#Jo18-7: Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" "Jesus of Nazareth," they said. 
#Jo18-8: Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men go." 
#Jo18-9: This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me." [^1] 
#Jo18-10: Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) 
#Jo18-11: Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?" 
#Jo18-12: Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him 
#Jo18-13: and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 
#Jo18-14: Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people. 
#Jo18-15: Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard, 
#Jo18-16: but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought Peter in. 
#Jo18-17: "You aren't one of this man's disciples too, are you?" she asked Peter. He replied, "I am not." 
#Jo18-18: It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself. 
#Jo18-19: Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. 
#Jo18-20: "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. 
#Jo18-21: Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said." 
#Jo18-22: When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded. 
#Jo18-23: "If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?" 
#Jo18-24: Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. 
#Jo18-25: Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked him, "You aren't one of his disciples too, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not." 
#Jo18-26: One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the garden?" 
#Jo18-27: Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. 
#Jo18-28: Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. 
#Jo18-29: So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?" 
#Jo18-30: "If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you." 
#Jo18-31: Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." "But we have no right to execute anyone," they objected. 
#Jo18-32: This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die. 
#Jo18-33: Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" 
#Jo18-34: "Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?" 
#Jo18-35: "Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?" 
#Jo18-36: Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place." 
#Jo18-37: "You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me." 
#Jo18-38: "What is truth?" retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him. 
#Jo18-39: But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?" 
#Jo18-40: They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.
 JOÃO 19
#Jo19-1: Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. 
#Jo19-2: The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe 
#Jo19-3: and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they slapped him in the face. 
#Jo19-4: Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him." 
#Jo19-5: When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!" 
#Jo19-6: As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him." 
#Jo19-7: The Jewish leaders insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God." 
#Jo19-8: When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, 
#Jo19-9: and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. 
#Jo19-10: "Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?" 
#Jo19-11: Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin." 
#Jo19-12: From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar." 
#Jo19-13: When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). 
#Jo19-14: It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews. 
#Jo19-15: But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered. 
#Jo19-16: Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. 
#Jo19-17: Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). 
#Jo19-18: There they crucified him, and with him two others —one on each side and Jesus in the middle. 
#Jo19-19: Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
#Jo19-20: Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. 
#Jo19-21: The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews." 
#Jo19-22: Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written." 
#Jo19-23: When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. 
#Jo19-24: "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, "They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment." "So this is what the soldiers did. 
#Jo19-25: Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 
#Jo19-26: When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, "here is your son," 
#Jo19-27: and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home. 
#Jo19-28: Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty." 
#Jo19-29: A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips. 
#Jo19-30: When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. 
#Jo19-31: Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. 
#Jo19-32: The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. 
#Jo19-33: But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 
#Jo19-34: Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. 
#Jo19-35: The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. 
#Jo19-36: These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," [^3] 
#Jo19-37: and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced." [^4] 
#Jo19-38: Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away. 
#Jo19-39: He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. [^5] 
#Jo19-40: Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs. 
#Jo19-41: At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. 
#Jo19-42: Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
 JOÃO 20
#Jo20-1: Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. 
#Jo20-2: So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!" 
#Jo20-3: So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. 
#Jo20-4: Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 
#Jo20-5: He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. 
#Jo20-6: Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, 
#Jo20-7: as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen. 
#Jo20-8: Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. 
#Jo20-9: (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.) 
#Jo20-10: Then the disciples went back to where they were staying. 
#Jo20-11: Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb 
#Jo20-12: and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot. 
#Jo20-13: They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him." 
#Jo20-14: At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus. 
#Jo20-15: He asked her, "Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him." 
#Jo20-16: Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means "Teacher"). 
#Jo20-17: Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'" 
#Jo20-18: Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her. 
#Jo20-19: On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" 
#Jo20-20: After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. 
#Jo20-21: Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." 
#Jo20-22: And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. 
#Jo20-23: If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven." 
#Jo20-24: Now Thomas (also known as Didymus "), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. 
#Jo20-25: So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe." 
#Jo20-26: A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" 
#Jo20-27: Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe." 
#Jo20-28: Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!" 
#Jo20-29: Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." 
#Jo20-30: Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. 
#Jo20-31: But these are written that you may believe "that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
 JOÃO 21
#Jo21-1: Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Galilee. "It happened this way: 
#Jo21-2: Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus "), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. 
#Jo21-3: "I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. 
#Jo21-4: Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. 
#Jo21-5: He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered. 
#Jo21-6: He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. 
#Jo21-7: Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. 
#Jo21-8: The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. [^3] 
#Jo21-9: When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. 
#Jo21-10: Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught." 
#Jo21-11: So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. 
#Jo21-12: Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord. 
#Jo21-13: Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. 
#Jo21-14: This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead. 
#Jo21-15: When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs." 
#Jo21-16: Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep." 
#Jo21-17: The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep. 
#Jo21-18: Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go." 
#Jo21-19: Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!" 
#Jo21-20: Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?") 
#Jo21-21: When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?" 
#Jo21-22: Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me." 
#Jo21-23: Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?" 
#Jo21-24: This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. 
#Jo21-25: Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.

#At1-1: In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 
#At1-2: until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 
#At1-3: After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 
#At1-4: On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. 
#At1-5: For John baptized with "water, but in a few days you will be baptized with "the Holy Spirit." 
#At1-6: Then they gathered around him and asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?" 
#At1-7: He said to them: "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. 
#At1-8: But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." 
#At1-9: After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. 
#At1-10: They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. 
#At1-11: "Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven." 
#At1-12: Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk "from the city. 
#At1-13: When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. 
#At1-14: They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. 
#At1-15: In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty) 
#At1-16: and said, "Brothers and sisters, "the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus. 
#At1-17: He was one of our number and shared in our ministry." 
#At1-18: (With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. 
#At1-19: Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) 
#At1-20: "For," said Peter, "it is written in the Book of Psalms: "'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' "and, "'May another take his place of leadership.' [^6] 
#At1-21: Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us, 
#At1-22: beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection." 
#At1-23: So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. 
#At1-24: Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen 
#At1-25: to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs." 
#At1-26: Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.

#At2-1: When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. 
#At2-2: Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
#At2-3: They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. 
#At2-4: All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues "as the Spirit enabled them. 
#At2-5: Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. 
#At2-6: When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken. 
#At2-7: Utterly amazed, they asked: "Aren't all these who are speaking Galileans? 
#At2-8: Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language? 
#At2-9: Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, [^2] 
#At2-10: Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome 
#At2-11: (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs —we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!" 
#At2-12: Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, "What does this mean?" 
#At2-13: Some, however, made fun of them and said, "They have had too much wine." 
#At2-14: Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. 
#At2-15: These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! 
#At2-16: No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: 
#At2-17: "'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. 
#At2-18: Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. 
#At2-19: I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. 
#At2-20: The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. 
#At2-21: And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' [^3] 
#At2-22: "Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. 
#At2-23: This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, "put him to death by nailing him to the cross. 
#At2-24: But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. 
#At2-25: David said about him: "'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 
#At2-26: Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope, 
#At2-27: because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your holy one see decay. 
#At2-28: You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' [^5] 
#At2-29: "Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. 
#At2-30: But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. 
#At2-31: Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay. 
#At2-32: God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it. 
#At2-33: Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. 
#At2-34: For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand 
#At2-35: until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."' [^6] 
#At2-36: "Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah." 
#At2-37: When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?" 
#At2-38: Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
#At2-39: The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off —for all whom the Lord our God will call." 
#At2-40: With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation." 
#At2-41: Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. 
#At2-42: They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. 
#At2-43: Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. 
#At2-44: All the believers were together and had everything in common. 
#At2-45: They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. 
#At2-46: Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 
#At2-47: praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

#At3-1: One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer —at three in the afternoon. 
#At3-2: Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. 
#At3-3: When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. 
#At3-4: Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!" 
#At3-5: So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. 
#At3-6: Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk." 
#At3-7: Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. 
#At3-8: He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. 
#At3-9: When all the people saw him walking and praising God, 
#At3-10: they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. 
#At3-11: While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade. 
#At3-12: When Peter saw this, he said to them: "Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? 
#At3-13: The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go. 
#At3-14: You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. 
#At3-15: You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. 
#At3-16: By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see. 
#At3-17: "Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. 
#At3-18: But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer. 
#At3-19: Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, 
#At3-20: and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you —even Jesus. 
#At3-21: Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets. 
#At3-22: For Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you. 
#At3-23: Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.' [^1] 
#At3-24: "Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days. 
#At3-25: And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, 'Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.' [^2] 
#At3-26: When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways."

#At4-1: The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. 
#At4-2: They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. 
#At4-3: They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. 
#At4-4: But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.

#At4-13: When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. 
#At4-14: But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. 
#At4-15: So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. 
#At4-16: "What are we going to do with these men?" they asked. "Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it. 
#At4-17: But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name." 
#At4-18: Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 
#At4-19: But Peter and John replied, "Which is right in God's eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges! 
#At4-20: As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard." 
#At4-21: After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. 
#At4-22: For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old. 
#At4-23: On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 
#At4-24: When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. "Sovereign Lord," they said, "you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. 
#At4-25: You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: "'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? 
#At4-26: The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed one. "' [^3] 
#At4-27: Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. 
#At4-28: They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. 
#At4-29: Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. 
#At4-30: Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus." 
#At4-31: After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. 
#At4-32: All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. 
#At4-33: With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God's grace was so powerfully at work in them all 
#At4-34: that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales 
#At4-35: and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need. 
#At4-36: Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means "son of encouragement"), 
#At4-37: sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.

#At5-1: Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. 
#At5-2: With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet. 
#At5-3: Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? 
#At5-4: Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God." 
#At5-5: When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. 
#At5-6: Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. 
#At5-7: About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
#At5-8: Peter asked her, "Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?" "Yes," she said, "that is the price." 
#At5-9: Peter said to her, "How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also." 
#At5-10: At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
#At5-11: Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. 
#At5-12: The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon's Colonnade. 
#At5-13: No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. 
#At5-14: Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. 
#At5-15: As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. 
#At5-16: Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed. 
#At5-17: Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. 
#At5-18: They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. 
#At5-19: But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out. 
#At5-20: "Go, stand in the temple courts," he said, "and tell the people all about this new life." 
#At5-21: At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin —the full assembly of the elders of Israel —and sent to the jail for the apostles. 
#At5-22: But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported, 
#At5-23: "We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside." 
#At5-24: On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to. 
#At5-25: Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people." 
#At5-26: At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them. 
#At5-27: The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. 
#At5-28: "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said. "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood." 
#At5-29: Peter and the other apostles replied: "We must obey God rather than human beings! 
#At5-30: The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead —whom you killed by hanging him on a cross. 
#At5-31: God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins. 
#At5-32: We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him." 
#At5-33: When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. 
#At5-34: But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. 
#At5-35: Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. 
#At5-36: Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. 
#At5-37: After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. 
#At5-38: Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. 
#At5-39: But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God." 
#At5-40: His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 
#At5-41: The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. 
#At5-42: Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.

#At6-1: In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews "among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. 
#At6-2: So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. 
#At6-3: Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them 
#At6-4: and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word." 
#At6-5: This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. 
#At6-6: They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. 
#At6-7: So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith. 
#At6-8: Now Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. 
#At6-9: Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called) —Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia —who began to argue with Stephen. 
#At6-10: But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke. 
#At6-11: Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, "We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God." 
#At6-12: So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. 
#At6-13: They produced false witnesses, who testified, "This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. 
#At6-14: For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us." 
#At6-15: All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

#At7-1: Then the high priest asked Stephen, "Are these charges true?" 
#At7-2: To this he replied: "Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran. 
#At7-3: 'Leave your country and your people,' God said, 'and go to the land I will show you.' [^1] 
#At7-4: "So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. 
#At7-5: He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. 
#At7-6: God spoke to him in this way: 'For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated. 
#At7-7: But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.' [^2] 
#At7-8: Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs. 
#At7-9: "Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him 
#At7-10: and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace. 
#At7-11: "Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food. 
#At7-12: When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on their first visit. 
#At7-13: On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family. 
#At7-14: After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. 
#At7-15: Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died. 
#At7-16: Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money. 
#At7-17: "As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased. 
#At7-18: Then 'a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.' [^3] 
#At7-19: He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die. 
#At7-20: "At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. "For three months he was cared for by his family. 
#At7-21: When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. 
#At7-22: Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action. 
#At7-23: "When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his own people, the Israelites. 
#At7-24: He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. 
#At7-25: Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. 
#At7-26: The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?' 
#At7-27: "But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, 'Who made you ruler and judge over us? 
#At7-28: Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' [^5] 
#At7-29: When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons. 
#At7-30: "After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. 
#At7-31: When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to get a closer look, he heard the Lord say: 
#At7-32: 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.' "Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look. 
#At7-33: "Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. 
#At7-34: I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.' [^7] 
#At7-35: "This is the same Moses they had rejected with the words, 'Who made you ruler and judge?' He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. 
#At7-36: He led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the wilderness. 
#At7-37: "This is the Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.' [^8] 
#At7-38: He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us. 
#At7-39: "But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. 
#At7-40: They told Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt —we don't know what has happened to him!' [^9] 
#At7-41: That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and reveled in what their own hands had made. 
#At7-42: But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: "'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel? 
#At7-43: You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. Therefore I will send you into exile' "beyond Babylon. 
#At7-44: "Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. 
#At7-45: After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David, 
#At7-46: who enjoyed God's favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. [^11] 
#At7-47: But it was Solomon who built a house for him. 
#At7-48: "However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says: 
#At7-49: "'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be? 
#At7-50: Has not my hand made all these things?' [^12] 
#At7-51: "You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit! 
#At7-52: Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him — 
#At7-53: you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it." 
#At7-54: When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. 
#At7-55: But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 
#At7-56: "Look," he said, "I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God." 
#At7-57: At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, 
#At7-58: dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. 
#At7-59: While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." 
#At7-60: Then he fell on his knees and cried out, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he fell asleep.

#At8-1: And Saul approved of their killing him. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. 
#At8-2: Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. 
#At8-3: But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. 
#At8-4: Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. 
#At8-5: Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there. 
#At8-6: When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. 
#At8-7: For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. 
#At8-8: So there was great joy in that city. 
#At8-9: Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, 
#At8-10: and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "This man is rightly called the Great Power of God." 
#At8-11: They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery. 
#At8-12: But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
#At8-13: Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw. 
#At8-14: When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria. 
#At8-15: When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit, 
#At8-16: because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
#At8-17: Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. 
#At8-18: When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money 
#At8-19: and said, "Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit." 
#At8-20: Peter answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! 
#At8-21: You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. 
#At8-22: Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. 
#At8-23: For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin." 
#At8-24: Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me." 
#At8-25: After they had further proclaimed the word of the Lord and testified about Jesus, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages. 
#At8-26: Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Go south to the road —the desert road —that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." 
#At8-27: So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian "eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means "queen of the Ethiopians"). This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, 
#At8-28: and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet. 
#At8-29: The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it." 
#At8-30: Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked. 
#At8-31: "How can I," he said, "unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 
#At8-32: This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading: "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. 
#At8-33: In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth." [^2] 
#At8-34: The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?" 
#At8-35: Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. 
#At8-36: As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?" 
#At8-37:  
#At8-38: And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. 
#At8-39: When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. 
#At8-40: Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.

#At9-1: Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest 
#At9-2: and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. 
#At9-3: As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 
#At9-4: He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" 
#At9-5: "Who are you, Lord?" Saul asked. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied. 
#At9-6: "Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do." 
#At9-7: The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. 
#At9-8: Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. 
#At9-9: For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything. 
#At9-10: In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "Ananias!" "Yes, Lord," he answered. 
#At9-11: The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. 
#At9-12: In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight." 
#At9-13: "Lord," Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. 
#At9-14: And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name." 
#At9-15: But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel. 
#At9-16: I will show him how much he must suffer for my name." 
#At9-17: Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord —Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here —has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit." 
#At9-18: Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, 
#At9-19: and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. 
#At9-20: At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. 
#At9-21: All those who heard him were astonished and asked, "Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?" 
#At9-22: Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah. 
#At9-23: After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him, 
#At9-24: but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him. 
#At9-25: But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall. 
#At9-26: When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. 
#At9-27: But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus. 
#At9-28: So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 
#At9-29: He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, "but they tried to kill him. 
#At9-30: When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus. 
#At9-31: Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers. 
#At9-32: As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord's people who lived in Lydda. 
#At9-33: There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years. 
#At9-34: "Aeneas," Peter said to him, "Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat." Immediately Aeneas got up. 
#At9-35: All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord. 
#At9-36: In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (in Greek her name is Dorcas); she was always doing good and helping the poor. 
#At9-37: About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.

#At10-1: At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. 
#At10-2: He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. 
#At10-3: One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!" 
#At10-4: Cornelius stared at him in fear. "What is it, Lord?" he asked. The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. 
#At10-5: Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. 
#At10-6: He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea." 
#At10-7: When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. 
#At10-8: He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. 
#At10-9: About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. 
#At10-10: He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. 
#At10-11: He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. 
#At10-12: It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds. 
#At10-13: Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat." 
#At10-14: "Surely not, Lord!" Peter replied. "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean." 
#At10-15: The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean." 
#At10-16: This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. 
#At10-17: While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. 
#At10-18: They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. 
#At10-19: While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Simon, three "men are looking for you. 
#At10-20: So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them." 
#At10-21: Peter went down and said to the men, "I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?" 
#At10-22: The men replied, "We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say." 
#At10-23: Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along. 
#At10-24: The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
#At10-25: As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. 
#At10-26: But Peter made him get up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man myself." 
#At10-27: While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. 
#At10-28: He said to them: "You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean. 
#At10-29: So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?" 
#At10-30: Cornelius answered: "Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me 
#At10-31: and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. 
#At10-32: Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' 
#At10-33: So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us." 
#At10-34: Then Peter began to speak: "I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism 
#At10-35: but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right. 
#At10-36: You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. 
#At10-37: You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached — 
#At10-38: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. 
#At10-39: "We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, 
#At10-40: but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. 
#At10-41: He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen —by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 
#At10-42: He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. 
#At10-43: All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name." 
#At10-44: While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. 
#At10-45: The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. 
#At10-46: For they heard them speaking in tongues "and praising God. Then Peter said, 
#At10-47: "Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have." 
#At10-48: So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.

#At11-1: The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
#At11-2: So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him 
#At11-3: and said, "You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them." 
#At11-4: Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story: 
#At11-5: "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. 
#At11-6: I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds. 
#At11-7: Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.' 
#At11-8: "I replied, 'Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' 
#At11-9: "The voice spoke from heaven a second time, 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.' 
#At11-10: This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again. 
#At11-11: "Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. 
#At11-12: The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house. 
#At11-13: He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. 
#At11-14: He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.' 
#At11-15: "As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. 
#At11-16: Then I remembered what the Lord had said: 'John baptized with "water, but you will be baptized with "the Holy Spirit.' 
#At11-17: So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God's way?" 
#At11-18: When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life." 
#At11-19: Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews. 
#At11-20: Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. 
#At11-21: The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord. 
#At11-22: News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
#At11-23: When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. 
#At11-24: He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord. 
#At11-25: Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, 
#At11-26: and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch. 
#At11-27: During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
#At11-28: One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)

#At12-2: He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. 
#At12-3: When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread. 
#At12-4: After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. 
#At12-5: So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. 
#At12-6: The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance. 
#At12-7: Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. "Quick, get up!" he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists. 
#At12-8: Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and sandals." And Peter did so. "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me," the angel told him. 
#At12-9: Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. 
#At12-10: They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him. 
#At12-11: Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen." 
#At12-12: When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. 
#At12-13: Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door. 
#At12-14: When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, "Peter is at the door!" 
#At12-15: "You're out of your mind," they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, "It must be his angel." 
#At12-16: But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. 
#At12-17: Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this," he said, and then he left for another place. 
#At12-18: In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. 
#At12-19: After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there. 
#At12-20: He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king's country for their food supply. 
#At12-21: On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. 
#At12-22: They shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man." 
#At12-23: Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.

#At13-2: While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."

#At13-6: They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, 
#At13-7: who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. 
#At13-8: But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith. 
#At13-9: Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, 
#At13-10: "You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? 
#At13-11: Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun." Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. 
#At13-12: When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord. 
#At13-13: From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.

#At13-16: Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: "Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me! 
#At13-17: The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country;

#At13-19: and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance. 
#At13-20: All this took about 450 years. "After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. 
#At13-21: Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. 
#At13-22: After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: 'I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.'

#At13-29: When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. 
#At13-30: But God raised him from the dead, 
#At13-31: and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people. 
#At13-32: "We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors 
#At13-33: he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: "'You are my son; today I have become your father.' [^2] 
#At13-34: God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said, "'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.' [^3] 
#At13-35: So it is also stated elsewhere: "'You will not let your holy one see decay.' [^4] 
#At13-36: "Now when David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.

#At13-45: When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him. 
#At13-46: Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: "We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. 
#At13-47: For this is what the Lord has commanded us: "'I have made you "a light for the Gentiles, that you "may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.' ""

#At14-8: In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked. 
#At14-9: He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed 
#At14-10: and called out, "Stand up on your feet!" At that, the man jumped up and began to walk. 
#At14-11: When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!" 
#At14-12: Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker. 
#At14-13: The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them. 
#At14-14: But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting: 
#At14-15: "Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.

#At14-18: Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them. 
#At14-19: Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead. 
#At14-20: But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe. 
#At14-21: They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,

#At15-3: The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad.

#At15-20: Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. 
#At15-21: For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."

#At15-31: The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. 
#At15-32: Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers. 
#At15-33: After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them. 
#At15-34:  
#At15-35: But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord. 
#At15-36: Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing." 
#At15-37: Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, 
#At15-38: but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. 
#At15-39: They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, 
#At15-40: but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord. 
#At15-41: He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

#At16-1: Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek. 
#At16-2: The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. 
#At16-3: Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 
#At16-4: As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. 
#At16-5: So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers. 
#At16-6: Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. 
#At16-7: When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to. 
#At16-8: So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. 
#At16-9: During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us." 
#At16-10: After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. 
#At16-11: From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis. 
#At16-12: From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district "of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days. 
#At16-13: On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there. 
#At16-14: One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message. 
#At16-15: When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. "If you consider me a believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us. 
#At16-16: Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. 
#At16-17: She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved." 
#At16-18: She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!" At that moment the spirit left her. 
#At16-19: When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. 
#At16-20: They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar 
#At16-21: by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice." 
#At16-22: The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods. 
#At16-23: After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. 
#At16-24: When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. 
#At16-25: About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. 
#At16-26: Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone's chains came loose. 
#At16-27: The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. 
#At16-28: But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!" 
#At16-29: The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. 
#At16-30: He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" 
#At16-31: They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved —you and your household." 
#At16-32: Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. 
#At16-33: At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized. 
#At16-34: The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God —he and his whole household. 
#At16-35: When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: "Release those men." 
#At16-36: The jailer told Paul, "The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace." 
#At16-37: But Paul said to the officers: "They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out." 
#At16-38: The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed. 
#At16-39: They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city. 
#At16-40: After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left.

#At17-1: When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. 
#At17-2: As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 
#At17-3: explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. "This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah," he said. 
#At17-4: Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women. 
#At17-5: But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. [^1] 
#At17-6: But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: "These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, 
#At17-7: and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus." 
#At17-8: When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. 
#At17-9: Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go. 
#At17-10: As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. 
#At17-11: Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. 
#At17-12: As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men. 
#At17-13: But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. 
#At17-14: The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. 
#At17-15: Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. 
#At17-16: While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. 
#At17-17: So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. 
#At17-18: A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others remarked, "He seems to be advocating foreign gods." They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. 
#At17-19: Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? 
#At17-20: You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean." 
#At17-21: (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) 
#At17-22: Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: "People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. 
#At17-23: For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship —and this is what I am going to proclaim to you. 
#At17-24: "The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. 
#At17-25: And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. 
#At17-26: From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. 
#At17-27: God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. 
#At17-28: 'For in him we live and move and have our being.' "As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.' [^3] 
#At17-29: "Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone —an image made by human design and skill. 
#At17-30: In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. 
#At17-31: For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead." 
#At17-32: When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, "We want to hear you again on this subject." 
#At17-33: At that, Paul left the Council. 
#At17-34: Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.

#At18-1: After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 
#At18-2: There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, 
#At18-3: and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. 
#At18-4: Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks. 
#At18-5: When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. 
#At18-6: But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." 
#At18-7: Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. 
#At18-8: Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized. 
#At18-9: One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. 
#At18-10: For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city." 
#At18-11: So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God. 
#At18-12: While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment. 
#At18-13: "This man," they charged, "is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law." 
#At18-14: Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, "If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you. 
#At18-15: But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law —settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things." 
#At18-16: So he drove them off. 
#At18-17: Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever. 
#At18-18: Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken. 
#At18-19: They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 
#At18-20: When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined. 
#At18-21: But as he left, he promised, "I will come back if it is God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus. 
#At18-22: When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch. 
#At18-23: After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. 
#At18-24: Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. 
#At18-25: He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor "and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. 
#At18-26: He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately. 
#At18-27: When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. 
#At18-28: For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.

#At19-1: While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples 
#At19-2: and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when "you believed?" They answered, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit." 
#At19-3: So Paul asked, "Then what baptism did you receive?" "John's baptism," they replied. 
#At19-4: Paul said, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus." 
#At19-5: On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
#At19-6: When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues "and prophesied. 
#At19-7: There were about twelve men in all. 
#At19-8: Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. 
#At19-9: But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. 
#At19-10: This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. 
#At19-11: God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, 
#At19-12: so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. 
#At19-13: Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, "In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out." 
#At19-14: Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. 
#At19-15: One day the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?" 
#At19-16: Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. 
#At19-17: When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. 
#At19-18: Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done. 
#At19-19: A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. [^3] 
#At19-20: In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. 
#At19-21: After all this had happened, Paul decided "to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. "After I have been there," he said, "I must visit Rome also." 
#At19-22: He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer. 
#At19-23: About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. 
#At19-24: A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there. 
#At19-25: He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: "You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business. 
#At19-26: And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all. 
#At19-27: There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty." 
#At19-28: When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" 
#At19-29: Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together. 
#At19-30: Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. 
#At19-31: Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater. 
#At19-32: The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. 
#At19-33: The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front, and they shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. 
#At19-34: But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" 
#At19-35: The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: "Fellow Ephesians, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? 
#At19-36: Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do anything rash. 
#At19-37: You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. 
#At19-38: If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. 
#At19-39: If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. 
#At19-40: As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what happened today. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it." 
#At19-41: After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.

#At20-1: When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia. 
#At20-2: He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece, 
#At20-3: where he stayed three months. Because some Jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia. 
#At20-4: He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. 
#At20-5: These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas. 
#At20-6: But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days. 
#At20-7: On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight. 
#At20-8: There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting. 
#At20-9: Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead. 
#At20-10: Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. "Don't be alarmed," he said. "He's alive!" 
#At20-11: Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left. 
#At20-12: The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted. 
#At20-13: We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot. 
#At20-14: When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene. 
#At20-15: The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus. 
#At20-16: Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost. 
#At20-17: From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church. 
#At20-18: When they arrived, he said to them: "You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia. 
#At20-19: I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents. 
#At20-20: You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house. 
#At20-21: I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus. 
#At20-22: "And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. 
#At20-23: I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. 
#At20-24: However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me —the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace. 
#At20-25: "Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again. 
#At20-26: Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you. 
#At20-27: For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. 
#At20-28: Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, "which he bought with his own blood. [^2] 
#At20-29: I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. 
#At20-30: Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them. 
#At20-31: So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears. 
#At20-32: "Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. 
#At20-33: I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing. 
#At20-34: You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions. 
#At20-35: In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' " 
#At20-36: When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. 
#At20-37: They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.

#At21-21: They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs. 
#At21-22: What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come, 
#At21-23: so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow. 
#At21-24: Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law. 
#At21-25: As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality." 
#At21-26: The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them. 
#At21-27: When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him, 
#At21-28: shouting, "Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place." 
#At21-29: (They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.) 
#At21-30: The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut. 
#At21-31: While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar. 
#At21-32: He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
#At21-33: The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. 
#At21-34: Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. 
#At21-35: When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers. 
#At21-36: The crowd that followed kept shouting, "Get rid of him!" 
#At21-37: As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, "May I say something to you?" "Do you speak Greek?" he replied. 
#At21-38: "Aren't you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago?" 
#At21-39: Paul answered, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people." 
#At21-40: After receiving the commander's permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic ":

#At22-1: "Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense." 
#At22-2: When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said: 
#At22-3: "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today. 
#At22-4: I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison, 
#At22-5: as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished. 
#At22-6: "About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. 
#At22-7: I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, 'Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?' 
#At22-8: "'Who are you, Lord?' I asked. " 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,' he replied. 
#At22-9: My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me. 
#At22-10: "'What shall I do, Lord?' I asked. " 'Get up,' the Lord said, 'and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.' 
#At22-11: My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me. 
#At22-12: "A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there. 
#At22-13: He stood beside me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very moment I was able to see him. 
#At22-14: "Then he said: 'The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth. 
#At22-15: You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard. 
#At22-16: And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.' 
#At22-17: "When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance 
#At22-18: and saw the Lord speaking to me. 'Quick!' he said. 'Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.' 
#At22-19: "'Lord,' I replied, 'these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you. 
#At22-20: And when the blood of your martyr "Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.' 
#At22-21: "Then the Lord said to me, 'Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.' " 
#At22-22: The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, "Rid the earth of him! He's not fit to live!" 
#At22-23: As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, 
#At22-24: the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this. 
#At22-25: As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, "Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty?" 
#At22-26: When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. "What are you going to do?" he asked. "This man is a Roman citizen." 
#At22-27: The commander went to Paul and asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes, I am," he answered. 
#At22-28: Then the commander said, "I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship." "But I was born a citizen," Paul replied. 
#At22-29: Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains. 
#At22-30: The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.

#At23-1: Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, "My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day." 
#At23-2: At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. 
#At23-3: Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!" 
#At23-4: Those who were standing near Paul said, "How dare you insult God's high priest!" 
#At23-5: Paul replied, "Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: 'Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.' "" 
#At23-6: Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, "My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead." 
#At23-7: When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 
#At23-8: (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.) 
#At23-9: There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. "We find nothing wrong with this man," they said. "What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?" 
#At23-10: The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks. 
#At23-11: The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome." 
#At23-12: The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. 
#At23-13: More than forty men were involved in this plot. 
#At23-14: They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, "We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul. 
#At23-15: Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here." 
#At23-16: But when the son of Paul's sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul. 
#At23-17: Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him." 
#At23-18: So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, "Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you." 
#At23-19: The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, "What is it you want to tell me?" 
#At23-20: He said: "Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him. 
#At23-21: Don't give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request." 
#At23-22: The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: "Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me." 
#At23-23: Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, "Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen "to go to Caesarea at nine tonight. 
#At23-24: Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix." 
#At23-25: He wrote a letter as follows: 
#At23-26: Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings. 
#At23-27: This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen. 
#At23-28: I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin. 
#At23-29: I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment. 
#At23-30: When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him. 
#At23-31: So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris. 
#At23-32: The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks. 
#At23-33: When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him. 
#At23-34: The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia, 
#At23-35: he said, "I will hear your case when your accusers get here." Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod's palace.

#At24-1: Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor. 
#At24-2: When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: "We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation. 
#At24-3: Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude. 
#At24-4: But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly. 
#At24-5: "We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect 
#At24-6: and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. 
#At24-7:  
#At24-8: By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him." 
#At24-9: The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true. 
#At24-10: When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: "I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense. 
#At24-11: You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 
#At24-12: My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. 
#At24-13: And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me. 
#At24-14: However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets, 
#At24-15: and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 
#At24-16: So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man. 
#At24-17: "After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. 
#At24-18: I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. 
#At24-19: But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. 
#At24-20: Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin — 
#At24-21: unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'" 
#At24-22: Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. "When Lysias the commander comes," he said, "I will decide your case." 
#At24-23: He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs. 
#At24-24: Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. 
#At24-25: As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you." 
#At24-26: At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him. 
#At24-27: When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.

#At25-1: Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem, 
#At25-2: where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul. 
#At25-3: They requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way. 
#At25-4: Festus answered, "Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon. 
#At25-5: Let some of your leaders come with me, and if the man has done anything wrong, they can press charges against him there." 
#At25-6: After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him. 
#At25-7: When Paul came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. They brought many serious charges against him, but they could not prove them. 
#At25-8: Then Paul made his defense: "I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar." 
#At25-9: Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?" 
#At25-10: Paul answered: "I am now standing before Caesar's court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well. 
#At25-11: If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!" 
#At25-12: After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!" 
#At25-13: A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus. 
#At25-14: Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul's case with the king. He said: "There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner. 
#At25-15: When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned. 
#At25-16: "I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before they have faced their accusers and have had an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges. 
#At25-17: When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in. 
#At25-18: When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected. 
#At25-19: Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive. 
#At25-20: I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges. 
#At25-21: But when Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar." 
#At25-22: Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear this man myself." He replied, "Tomorrow you will hear him." 
#At25-23: The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. 
#At25-24: Festus said: "King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. 
#At25-25: I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome. 
#At25-26: But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write. 
#At25-27: For I think it is unreasonable to send a prisoner on to Rome without specifying the charges against him."

#At26-1: Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense: 
#At26-2: "King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews, 
#At26-3: and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently. 
#At26-4: "The Jewish people all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem. 
#At26-5: They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee. 
#At26-6: And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our ancestors that I am on trial today. 
#At26-7: This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. King Agrippa, it is because of this hope that these Jews are accusing me. 
#At26-8: Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead? 
#At26-9: "I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
#At26-10: And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the Lord's people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them. 
#At26-11: Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was so obsessed with persecuting them that I even hunted them down in foreign cities. 
#At26-12: "On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. 
#At26-13: About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions. 
#At26-14: We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, "'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.' 
#At26-15: "Then I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' " 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied. 
#At26-16: 'Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me. 
#At26-17: I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them 
#At26-18: to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.' 
#At26-19: "So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven. 
#At26-20: First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds. 
#At26-21: That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me. 
#At26-22: But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen — 
#At26-23: that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles." 
#At26-24: At this point Festus interrupted Paul's defense. "You are out of your mind, Paul!" he shouted. "Your great learning is driving you insane." 
#At26-25: "I am not insane, most excellent Festus," Paul replied. "What I am saying is true and reasonable. 
#At26-26: The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner. 
#At26-27: King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do." 
#At26-28: Then Agrippa said to Paul, "Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?" 
#At26-29: Paul replied, "Short time or long —I pray to God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains." 
#At26-30: The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them. 
#At26-31: After they left the room, they began saying to one another, "This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment." 
#At26-32: Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."

#At27-1: When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment. 
#At27-2: We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. 
#At27-3: The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs. 
#At27-4: From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. 
#At27-5: When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. 
#At27-6: There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. 
#At27-7: We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. 
#At27-8: We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. 
#At27-9: Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Day of Atonement. "So Paul warned them, 
#At27-10: "Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also." 
#At27-11: But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship. 
#At27-12: Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest. 
#At27-13: When a gentle south wind began to blow, they saw their opportunity; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete. 
#At27-14: Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the Northeaster, swept down from the island. 
#At27-15: The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along. 
#At27-16: As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure, 
#At27-17: so the men hoisted it aboard. Then they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Because they were afraid they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor "and let the ship be driven along. 
#At27-18: We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. 
#At27-19: On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. 
#At27-20: When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved. 
#At27-21: After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: "Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss. 
#At27-22: But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed. 
#At27-23: Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me 
#At27-24: and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.' 
#At27-25: So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me. 
#At27-26: Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island." 
#At27-27: On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic "Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land. 
#At27-28: They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet "deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet "deep. 
#At27-29: Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight. 
#At27-30: In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow. 
#At27-31: Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved." 
#At27-32: So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away. 
#At27-33: Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. "For the last fourteen days," he said, "you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food —you haven't eaten anything. 
#At27-34: Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head." 
#At27-35: After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. 
#At27-36: They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. 
#At27-37: Altogether there were 276 of us on board. 
#At27-38: When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. 
#At27-39: When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. 
#At27-40: Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. 
#At27-41: But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf. 
#At27-42: The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping. 
#At27-43: But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. 
#At27-44: The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land safely.
 ATOS DOS APÓSTOLOS 28
#At28-1: Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta. 
#At28-2: The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. 
#At28-3: Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand. 
#At28-4: When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, "This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, the goddess Justice has not allowed him to live." 
#At28-5: But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. 
#At28-6: The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god. 
#At28-7: There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and showed us generous hospitality for three days. 
#At28-8: His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him. 
#At28-9: When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured. 
#At28-10: They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed. 
#At28-11: After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island —it was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux. 
#At28-12: We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days. 
#At28-13: From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli. 
#At28-14: There we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome. 
#At28-15: The brothers and sisters there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these people Paul thanked God and was encouraged. 
#At28-16: When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him. 
#At28-17: Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: "My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. 
#At28-18: They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death. 
#At28-19: The Jews objected, so I was compelled to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people. 
#At28-20: For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain." 
#At28-21: They replied, "We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you. 
#At28-22: But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect." 
#At28-23: They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus. 
#At28-24: Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe. 
#At28-25: They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: "The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he said through Isaiah the prophet: 
#At28-26: "'Go to this people and say, "You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving." 
#At28-27: For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' [^1] 
#At28-28: "Therefore I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!" 
#At28-29:  
#At28-30: For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him. 
#At28-31: He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ —with all boldness and without hindrance!
ROMANOS
 ROMANOS 1
#Rm1-1: Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God — 
#Rm1-2: the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures 
#Rm1-3: regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life "was a descendant of David, 
#Rm1-4: and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power "by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. 
#Rm1-5: Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from "faith for his name's sake. 
#Rm1-6: And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. 
#Rm1-7: To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
#Rm1-8: First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world. 
#Rm1-9: God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you 
#Rm1-10: in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you. 
#Rm1-11: I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong — 
#Rm1-12: that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith. 
#Rm1-13: I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, "that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles. 
#Rm1-14: I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. 
#Rm1-15: That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome. 
#Rm1-16: For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. 
#Rm1-17: For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed —a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, "just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith." [^6] 
#Rm1-18: The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 
#Rm1-19: since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 
#Rm1-20: For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities —his eternal power and divine nature —have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. 
#Rm1-21: For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 
#Rm1-22: Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 
#Rm1-23: and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles. 
#Rm1-24: Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 
#Rm1-25: They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator —who is forever praised. Amen. 
#Rm1-26: Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 
#Rm1-27: In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. 
#Rm1-28: Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 
#Rm1-29: They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 
#Rm1-30: slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 
#Rm1-31: they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. 
#Rm1-32: Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
 ROMANOS 2
#Rm2-1: You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. 
#Rm2-2: Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. 
#Rm2-3: So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment? 
#Rm2-4: Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance? 
#Rm2-5: But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. 
#Rm2-6: God "will repay each person according to what they have done." [^1] 
#Rm2-7: To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. 
#Rm2-8: But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. 
#Rm2-9: There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; 
#Rm2-10: but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. 
#Rm2-11: For God does not show favoritism. 
#Rm2-12: All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 
#Rm2-13: For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 
#Rm2-14: (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 
#Rm2-15: They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) 
#Rm2-16: This will take place on the day when God judges people's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares. 
#Rm2-17: Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God; 
#Rm2-18: if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; 
#Rm2-19: if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark, 
#Rm2-20: an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth — 
#Rm2-21: you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? 
#Rm2-22: You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 
#Rm2-23: You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? 
#Rm2-24: As it is written: "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." [^2] 
#Rm2-25: Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. 
#Rm2-26: So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? 
#Rm2-27: The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the "written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker. 
#Rm2-28: A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. 
#Rm2-29: No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person's praise is not from other people, but from God.
 ROMANOS 3
#Rm3-1: What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? 
#Rm3-2: Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God. 
#Rm3-3: What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God's faithfulness? 
#Rm3-4: Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: "So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge." [^1] 
#Rm3-5: But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.) 
#Rm3-6: Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? 
#Rm3-7: Someone might argue, "If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?" 
#Rm3-8: Why not say —as some slanderously claim that we say —"Let us do evil that good may result"? Their condemnation is just! 
#Rm3-9: What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin. 
#Rm3-10: As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one; 
#Rm3-11: there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. 
#Rm3-12: All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one." [^2] 
#Rm3-13: "Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit." ""The poison of vipers is on their lips." [^4] 
#Rm3-14: "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness." [^5] 
#Rm3-15: "Their feet are swift to shed blood; 
#Rm3-16: ruin and misery mark their ways, 
#Rm3-17: and the way of peace they do not know." [^6] 
#Rm3-18: "There is no fear of God before their eyes." [^7] 
#Rm3-19: Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. 
#Rm3-20: Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. 
#Rm3-21: But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 
#Rm3-22: This righteousness is given through faith in "Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, 
#Rm3-23: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
#Rm3-24: and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 
#Rm3-25: God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, "through the shedding of his blood —to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished — 
#Rm3-26: he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. 
#Rm3-27: Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. 
#Rm3-28: For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 
#Rm3-29: Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, 
#Rm3-30: since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. 
#Rm3-31: Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.
 ROMANOS 4
#Rm4-1: What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter? 
#Rm4-2: If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about —but not before God. 
#Rm4-3: What does Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." [^1] 
#Rm4-4: Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. 
#Rm4-5: However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. 
#Rm4-6: David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 
#Rm4-7: "Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. 
#Rm4-8: Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them." [^2] 
#Rm4-9: Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness. 
#Rm4-10: Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before! 
#Rm4-11: And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. 
#Rm4-12: And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. 
#Rm4-13: It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. 
#Rm4-14: For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless, 
#Rm4-15: because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression. 
#Rm4-16: Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring —not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. 
#Rm4-17: As it is written: "I have made you a father of many nations." "He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed —the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not. 
#Rm4-18: Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be." [^4] 
#Rm4-19: Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead —since he was about a hundred years old —and that Sarah's womb was also dead. 
#Rm4-20: Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, 
#Rm4-21: being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. 
#Rm4-22: This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness." 
#Rm4-23: The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone, 
#Rm4-24: but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness —for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 
#Rm4-25: He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
 ROMANOS 5
#Rm5-1: Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we "have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
#Rm5-2: through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we "boast in the hope of the glory of God. 
#Rm5-3: Not only so, but we "also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; 
#Rm5-4: perseverance, character; and character, hope. 
#Rm5-5: And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. 
#Rm5-6: You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. 
#Rm5-7: Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. 
#Rm5-8: But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 
#Rm5-9: Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! 
#Rm5-10: For if, while we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! 
#Rm5-11: Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. 
#Rm5-12: Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned — 
#Rm5-13: To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone's account where there is no law. 
#Rm5-14: Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come. 
#Rm5-15: But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! 
#Rm5-16: Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. 
#Rm5-17: For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ! 
#Rm5-18: Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. 
#Rm5-19: For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. 
#Rm5-20: The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 
#Rm5-21: so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
 ROMANOS 6
#Rm6-1: What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? 
#Rm6-2: By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? 
#Rm6-3: Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
#Rm6-4: We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. 
#Rm6-5: For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. 
#Rm6-6: For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, "that we should no longer be slaves to sin — 
#Rm6-7: because anyone who has died has been set free from sin. 
#Rm6-8: Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 
#Rm6-9: For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. 
#Rm6-10: The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. 
#Rm6-11: In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. 
#Rm6-12: Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. 
#Rm6-13: Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. 
#Rm6-14: For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace. 
#Rm6-15: What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means! 
#Rm6-16: Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey —whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? 
#Rm6-17: But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. 
#Rm6-18: You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. 
#Rm6-19: I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness. 
#Rm6-20: When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. 
#Rm6-21: What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! 
#Rm6-22: But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. 
#Rm6-23: For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in "Christ Jesus our Lord.
 ROMANOS 7
#Rm7-1: Do you not know, brothers and sisters —for I am speaking to those who know the law —that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives? 
#Rm7-2: For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. 
#Rm7-3: So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man. 
#Rm7-4: So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. 
#Rm7-5: For when we were in the realm of the flesh, "the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. 
#Rm7-6: But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code. 
#Rm7-7: What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "You shall not covet." [^2] 
#Rm7-8: But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead. 
#Rm7-9: Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. 
#Rm7-10: I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. 
#Rm7-11: For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. 
#Rm7-12: So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. 
#Rm7-13: Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful. 
#Rm7-14: We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 
#Rm7-15: I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 
#Rm7-16: And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 
#Rm7-17: As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 
#Rm7-18: For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. "For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 
#Rm7-19: For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do —this I keep on doing. 
#Rm7-20: Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. 
#Rm7-21: So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 
#Rm7-22: For in my inner being I delight in God's law; 
#Rm7-23: but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 
#Rm7-24: What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 
#Rm7-25: Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in my sinful nature "a slave to the law of sin.
 ROMANOS 8
#Rm8-1: Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, 
#Rm8-2: because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you "free from the law of sin and death. 
#Rm8-3: For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, "God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. "And so he condemned sin in the flesh, 
#Rm8-4: in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 
#Rm8-5: Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 
#Rm8-6: The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. 
#Rm8-7: The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. 
#Rm8-8: Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God. 
#Rm8-9: You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ. 
#Rm8-10: But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life "because of righteousness. 
#Rm8-11: And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of "his Spirit who lives in you. 
#Rm8-12: Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation —but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it. 
#Rm8-13: For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live. 
#Rm8-14: For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. 
#Rm8-15: The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. "And by him we cry, "Father." 
#Rm8-16: The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. 
#Rm8-17: Now if we are children, then we are heirs —heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. 
#Rm8-18: I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. 
#Rm8-19: For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. 
#Rm8-20: For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope 
#Rm8-21: that "the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God. 
#Rm8-22: We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. 
#Rm8-23: Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies. 
#Rm8-24: For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have? 
#Rm8-25: But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. 
#Rm8-26: In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. 
#Rm8-27: And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God. 
#Rm8-28: And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who "have been called according to his purpose. 
#Rm8-29: For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. 
#Rm8-30: And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. 
#Rm8-31: What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
#Rm8-32: He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all —how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? 
#Rm8-33: Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. 
#Rm8-34: Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died —more than that, who was raised to life —is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. 
#Rm8-35: Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? 
#Rm8-36: As it is written: "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered." [^10] 
#Rm8-37: No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 
#Rm8-38: For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, "neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 
#Rm8-39: neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
 ROMANOS 9
#Rm9-1: I speak the truth in Christ —I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit — 
#Rm9-2: I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 
#Rm9-3: For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race, 
#Rm9-4: the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. 
#Rm9-5: Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised! "Amen. 
#Rm9-6: It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. 
#Rm9-7: Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned." [^2] 
#Rm9-8: In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring. 
#Rm9-9: For this was how the promise was stated: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son." [^3] 
#Rm9-10: Not only that, but Rebekah's children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac. 
#Rm9-11: Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad —in order that God's purpose in election might stand: 
#Rm9-12: not by works but by him who calls —she was told, "The older will serve the younger." [^4] 
#Rm9-13: Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." [^5] 
#Rm9-14: What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! 
#Rm9-15: For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." [^6] 
#Rm9-16: It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God's mercy. 
#Rm9-17: For Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." [^7] 
#Rm9-18: Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. 
#Rm9-19: One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?" 
#Rm9-20: But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'" [^8] 
#Rm9-21: Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use? 
#Rm9-22: What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath —prepared for destruction? 
#Rm9-23: What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory — 
#Rm9-24: even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 
#Rm9-25: As he says in Hosea: "I will call them 'my people' who are not my people; and I will call her 'my loved one' who is not my loved one," [^9] 
#Rm9-26: and, "In the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'children of the living God.'" [^10] 
#Rm9-27: Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved. 
#Rm9-28: For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality." [^11] 
#Rm9-29: It is just as Isaiah said previously: "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah." [^12] 
#Rm9-30: What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; 
#Rm9-31: but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal. 
#Rm9-32: Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone. 
#Rm9-33: As it is written: "See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame." [^13]
 ROMANOS 10
#Rm10-1: Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. 
#Rm10-2: For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. 
#Rm10-3: Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. 
#Rm10-4: Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. 
#Rm10-5: Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: "The person who does these things will live by them." [^1] 
#Rm10-6: But the righteousness that is by faith says: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'" "(that is, to bring Christ down) 
#Rm10-7: "or 'Who will descend into the deep?'" "(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 
#Rm10-8: But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," "that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 
#Rm10-9: If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 
#Rm10-10: For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 
#Rm10-11: As Scripture says, "Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame." [^5] 
#Rm10-12: For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile —the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 
#Rm10-13: for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." [^6] 
#Rm10-14: How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 
#Rm10-15: And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!" [^7] 
#Rm10-16: But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?" [^8] 
#Rm10-17: Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. 
#Rm10-18: But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." [^9] 
#Rm10-19: Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, "I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding." [^10] 
#Rm10-20: And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me." [^11] 
#Rm10-21: But concerning Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people." [^12]
 ROMANOS 11
#Rm11-1: I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
#Rm11-2: God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah —how he appealed to God against Israel: 
#Rm11-3: "Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me" "? 
#Rm11-4: And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." [^2] 
#Rm11-5: So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 
#Rm11-6: And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. 
#Rm11-7: What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened, 
#Rm11-8: as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day." [^3] 
#Rm11-9: And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them. 
#Rm11-10: May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever." [^4] 
#Rm11-11: Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 
#Rm11-12: But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring! 
#Rm11-13: I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry 
#Rm11-14: in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. 
#Rm11-15: For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 
#Rm11-16: If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. 
#Rm11-17: If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, 
#Rm11-18: do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 
#Rm11-19: You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in." 
#Rm11-20: Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. 
#Rm11-21: For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. 
#Rm11-22: Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 
#Rm11-23: And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 
#Rm11-24: After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! 
#Rm11-25: I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, 
#Rm11-26: and in this way "all Israel will be saved. As it is written: "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. 
#Rm11-27: And this is "my covenant with them when I take away their sins." [^7] 
#Rm11-28: As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, 
#Rm11-29: for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. 
#Rm11-30: Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, 
#Rm11-31: so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now "receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. 
#Rm11-32: For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. 
#Rm11-33: Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and "knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! 
#Rm11-34: "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?" [^10] 
#Rm11-35: "Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?" [^11] 
#Rm11-36: For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.
 ROMANOS 12
#Rm12-1: Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God —this is your true and proper worship. 
#Rm12-2: Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is —his good, pleasing and perfect will. 
#Rm12-3: For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. 
#Rm12-4: For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 
#Rm12-5: so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. 
#Rm12-6: We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your "faith; 
#Rm12-7: if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; 
#Rm12-8: if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, "do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully. 
#Rm12-9: Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 
#Rm12-10: Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. 
#Rm12-11: Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 
#Rm12-12: Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 
#Rm12-13: Share with the Lord's people who are in need. Practice hospitality. 
#Rm12-14: Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 
#Rm12-15: Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. 
#Rm12-16: Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. "Do not be conceited. 
#Rm12-17: Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. 
#Rm12-18: If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 
#Rm12-19: Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," "says the Lord. 
#Rm12-20: On the contrary: "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head." [^5] 
#Rm12-21: Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
 ROMANOS 13
#Rm13-1: Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 
#Rm13-2: Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 
#Rm13-3: For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 
#Rm13-4: For the one in authority is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God's servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 
#Rm13-5: Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience. 
#Rm13-6: This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. 
#Rm13-7: Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. 
#Rm13-8: Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. 
#Rm13-9: The commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," "You shall not covet," "and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." [^2] 
#Rm13-10: Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. 
#Rm13-11: And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. 
#Rm13-12: The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 
#Rm13-13: Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. 
#Rm13-14: Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh. [^3]
 ROMANOS 14
#Rm14-1: Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters. 
#Rm14-2: One person's faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. 
#Rm14-3: The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them. 
#Rm14-4: Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand. 
#Rm14-5: One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind. 
#Rm14-6: Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. 
#Rm14-7: For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. 
#Rm14-8: If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. 
#Rm14-9: For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. 
#Rm14-10: You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister "? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. 
#Rm14-11: It is written: "'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.'" [^2] 
#Rm14-12: So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God. 
#Rm14-13: Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister. 
#Rm14-14: I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean. 
#Rm14-15: If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died. 
#Rm14-16: Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil. 
#Rm14-17: For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, 
#Rm14-18: because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval. 
#Rm14-19: Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. 
#Rm14-20: Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. 
#Rm14-21: It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall. 
#Rm14-22: So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves. 
#Rm14-23: But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin. [^3]
 ROMANOS 15
#Rm15-1: We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. 
#Rm15-2: Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up. 
#Rm15-3: For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me." [^1] 
#Rm15-4: For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope. 
#Rm15-5: May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, 
#Rm15-6: so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#Rm15-7: Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God. 
#Rm15-8: For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews "on behalf of God's truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed 
#Rm15-9: and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing the praises of your name." [^3] 
#Rm15-10: Again, it says, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people." [^4] 
#Rm15-11: And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol him." [^5] 
#Rm15-12: And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope." [^6] 
#Rm15-13: May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
#Rm15-14: I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another. 
#Rm15-15: Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me 
#Rm15-16: to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 
#Rm15-17: Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God. 
#Rm15-18: I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done — 
#Rm15-19: by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ. 
#Rm15-20: It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation. 
#Rm15-21: Rather, as it is written: "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand." [^7] 
#Rm15-22: This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you. 
#Rm15-23: But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you, 
#Rm15-24: I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. 
#Rm15-25: Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord's people there. 
#Rm15-26: For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord's people in Jerusalem. 
#Rm15-27: They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings. 
#Rm15-28: So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way. 
#Rm15-29: I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ. 
#Rm15-30: I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. 
#Rm15-31: Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord's people there, 
#Rm15-32: so that I may come to you with joy, by God's will, and in your company be refreshed. 
#Rm15-33: The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
 ROMANOS 16
#Rm16-1: I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon ""of the church in Cenchreae. 
#Rm16-2: I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many people, including me. 
#Rm16-3: Greet Priscilla "and Aquila, my co-workers in Christ Jesus. 
#Rm16-4: They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them. 
#Rm16-5: Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia. 
#Rm16-6: Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you. 
#Rm16-7: Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among "the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was. 
#Rm16-8: Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. 
#Rm16-9: Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys. 
#Rm16-10: Greet Apelles, whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus. 
#Rm16-11: Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord. 
#Rm16-12: Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord. 
#Rm16-13: Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too. 
#Rm16-14: Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the other brothers and sisters with them. 
#Rm16-15: Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the Lord's people who are with them. 
#Rm16-16: Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings. 
#Rm16-17: I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. 
#Rm16-18: For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people. 
#Rm16-19: Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil. 
#Rm16-20: The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. 
#Rm16-21: Timothy, my co-worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my fellow Jews. 
#Rm16-22: I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord. 
#Rm16-23: Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings. 
#Rm16-24:  
#Rm16-25: Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past, 
#Rm16-26: but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from "faith — 
#Rm16-27: to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
1 CORÍNTIOS
 1 CORÍNTIOS 1
#1 Co1-1: Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, 
#1 Co1-2: To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ —their Lord and ours: 
#1 Co1-3: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
#1 Co1-4: I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus. 
#1 Co1-5: For in him you have been enriched in every way —with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge — 
#1 Co1-6: God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you. 
#1 Co1-7: Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. 
#1 Co1-8: He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#1 Co1-9: God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. 
#1 Co1-10: I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought. 
#1 Co1-11: My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you. 
#1 Co1-12: What I mean is this: One of you says, "I follow Paul"; another, "I follow Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas ""; still another, "I follow Christ." 
#1 Co1-13: Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul? 
#1 Co1-14: I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 
#1 Co1-15: so no one can say that you were baptized in my name. 
#1 Co1-16: (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.) 
#1 Co1-17: For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel —not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. 
#1 Co1-18: For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
#1 Co1-19: For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate." [^3] 
#1 Co1-20: Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 
#1 Co1-21: For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 
#1 Co1-22: Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 
#1 Co1-23: but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 
#1 Co1-24: but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
#1 Co1-25: For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. 
#1 Co1-26: Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 
#1 Co1-27: But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 
#1 Co1-28: God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things —and the things that are not —to nullify the things that are, 
#1 Co1-29: so that no one may boast before him. 
#1 Co1-30: It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God —that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 
#1 Co1-31: Therefore, as it is written: "Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord." [^4]
 1 CORÍNTIOS 2
#1 Co2-1: And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. [^1] 
#1 Co2-2: For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 
#1 Co2-3: I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling. 
#1 Co2-4: My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power, 
#1 Co2-5: so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power. 
#1 Co2-6: We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 
#1 Co2-7: No, we declare God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 
#1 Co2-8: None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
#1 Co2-9: However, as it is written: "What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived" "— the things God has prepared for those who love him — 
#1 Co2-10: these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 
#1 Co2-11: For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 
#1 Co2-12: What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 
#1 Co2-13: This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. [^3] 
#1 Co2-14: The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 
#1 Co2-15: The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, 
#1 Co2-16: for, "Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" "But we have the mind of Christ.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 3
#1 Co3-1: Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly —mere infants in Christ. 
#1 Co3-2: I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. 
#1 Co3-3: You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans? 
#1 Co3-4: For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere human beings? 
#1 Co3-5: What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe —as the Lord has assigned to each his task. 
#1 Co3-6: I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. 
#1 Co3-7: So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 
#1 Co3-8: The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. 
#1 Co3-9: For we are co-workers in God's service; you are God's field, God's building. 
#1 Co3-10: By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. 
#1 Co3-11: For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
#1 Co3-12: If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 
#1 Co3-13: their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work. 
#1 Co3-14: If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. 
#1 Co3-15: If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved —even though only as one escaping through the flames. 
#1 Co3-16: Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst? 
#1 Co3-17: If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person; for God's temple is sacred, and you together are that temple. 
#1 Co3-18: Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become "fools" so that you may become wise. 
#1 Co3-19: For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness" "; 
#1 Co3-20: and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile." [^2] 
#1 Co3-21: So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, 
#1 Co3-22: whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas "or the world or life or death or the present or the future —all are yours, 
#1 Co3-23: and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 4
#1 Co4-1: This, then, is how you ought to regard us: as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed. 
#1 Co4-2: Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. 
#1 Co4-3: I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. 
#1 Co4-4: My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 
#1 Co4-5: Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God. 
#1 Co4-6: Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written." Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other. 
#1 Co4-7: For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not? 
#1 Co4-8: Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign —and that without us! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you! 
#1 Co4-9: For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like those condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to human beings. 
#1 Co4-10: We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored! 
#1 Co4-11: To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless. 
#1 Co4-12: We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; 
#1 Co4-13: when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world —right up to this moment. 
#1 Co4-14: I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children. 
#1 Co4-15: Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel. 
#1 Co4-16: Therefore I urge you to imitate me. 
#1 Co4-17: For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church. 
#1 Co4-18: Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. 
#1 Co4-19: But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have. 
#1 Co4-20: For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power. 
#1 Co4-21: What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline, or shall I come in love and with a gentle spirit?
 1 CORÍNTIOS 5
#1 Co5-1: It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: A man has his father's wife. 
#1 Co5-2: And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this? 
#1 Co5-3: Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present. 
#1 Co5-4: When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, 
#1 Co5-5: hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord. 
#1 Co5-6: Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough? 
#1 Co5-7: Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast--as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
#1 Co5-8: Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth. 
#1 Co5-9: I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people-- 
#1 Co5-10: not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. 
#1 Co5-11: But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat. 
#1 Co5-12: What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? 
#1 Co5-13: God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked man from among you."
 1 CORÍNTIOS 6
#1 Co6-1: If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord's people? 
#1 Co6-2: Or do you not know that the Lord's people will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? 
#1 Co6-3: Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life! 
#1 Co6-4: Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church? 
#1 Co6-5: I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers? 
#1 Co6-6: But instead, one brother takes another to court —and this in front of unbelievers! 
#1 Co6-7: The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? 
#1 Co6-8: Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters. 
#1 Co6-9: Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men [^1] 
#1 Co6-10: nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 
#1 Co6-11: And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. 
#1 Co6-12: "I have the right to do anything," you say —but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything" —but I will not be mastered by anything. 
#1 Co6-13: You say, "Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both." The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 
#1 Co6-14: By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. 
#1 Co6-15: Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! 
#1 Co6-16: Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh." [^2] 
#1 Co6-17: But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit. [^3] 
#1 Co6-18: Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. 
#1 Co6-19: Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 
#1 Co6-20: you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 7
#1 Co7-1: Now for the matters you wrote about: "It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman." 
#1 Co7-2: But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. 
#1 Co7-3: The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. 
#1 Co7-4: The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. 
#1 Co7-5: Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 
#1 Co7-6: I say this as a concession, not as a command. 
#1 Co7-7: I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. 
#1 Co7-8: Now to the unmarried "and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do. 
#1 Co7-9: But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. 
#1 Co7-10: To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 
#1 Co7-11: But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. 
#1 Co7-12: To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. 
#1 Co7-13: And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 
#1 Co7-14: For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. 
#1 Co7-15: But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. 
#1 Co7-16: How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? 
#1 Co7-17: Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. 
#1 Co7-18: Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. 
#1 Co7-19: Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. 
#1 Co7-20: Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them. 
#1 Co7-21: Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you —although if you can gain your freedom, do so. 
#1 Co7-22: For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord's freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ's slave. 
#1 Co7-23: You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings. 
#1 Co7-24: Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them. 
#1 Co7-25: Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. 
#1 Co7-26: Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. 
#1 Co7-27: Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. 
#1 Co7-28: But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. 
#1 Co7-29: What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; 
#1 Co7-30: those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; 
#1 Co7-31: those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. 
#1 Co7-32: I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs —how he can please the Lord. 
#1 Co7-33: But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world —how he can please his wife — 
#1 Co7-34: and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world —how she can please her husband. 
#1 Co7-35: I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. 
#1 Co7-36: If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong "and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. 
#1 Co7-37: But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin —this man also does the right thing. 
#1 Co7-38: So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better. [^3] 
#1 Co7-39: A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. 
#1 Co7-40: In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is —and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 8
#1 Co8-1: Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that "We all possess knowledge." But knowledge puffs up while love builds up. 
#1 Co8-2: Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know. 
#1 Co8-3: But whoever loves God is known by God. [^1] 
#1 Co8-4: So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that "An idol is nothing at all in the world" and that "There is no God but one." 
#1 Co8-5: For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"), 
#1 Co8-6: yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. 
#1 Co8-7: But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 
#1 Co8-8: But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. 
#1 Co8-9: Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 
#1 Co8-10: For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, won't that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols? 
#1 Co8-11: So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 
#1 Co8-12: When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 
#1 Co8-13: Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 9
#1 Co9-1: Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? 
#1 Co9-2: Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. 
#1 Co9-3: This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. 
#1 Co9-4: Don't we have the right to food and drink? 
#1 Co9-5: Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas "? 
#1 Co9-6: Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living? 
#1 Co9-7: Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk? 
#1 Co9-8: Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn't the Law say the same thing? 
#1 Co9-9: For it is written in the Law of Moses: "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." "Is it about oxen that God is concerned? 
#1 Co9-10: Surely he says this for us, doesn't he? Yes, this was written for us, because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest. 
#1 Co9-11: If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? 
#1 Co9-12: If others have this right of support from you, shouldn't we have it all the more? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. 
#1 Co9-13: Don't you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? 
#1 Co9-14: In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. 
#1 Co9-15: But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me, for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast. 
#1 Co9-16: For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 
#1 Co9-17: If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. 
#1 Co9-18: What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel. 
#1 Co9-19: Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. 
#1 Co9-20: To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. 
#1 Co9-21: To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law. 
#1 Co9-22: To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. 
#1 Co9-23: I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings. 
#1 Co9-24: Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. 
#1 Co9-25: Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. 
#1 Co9-26: Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air. 
#1 Co9-27: No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 10
#1 Co10-1: For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. 
#1 Co10-2: They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. 
#1 Co10-3: They all ate the same spiritual food 
#1 Co10-4: and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. 
#1 Co10-5: Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered over the desert. 
#1 Co10-6: Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. 
#1 Co10-7: Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: "The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry." 
#1 Co10-8: We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did--and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. 
#1 Co10-9: We should not test the Lord, as some of them did--and were killed by snakes. 
#1 Co10-10: And do not grumble, as some of them did--and were killed by the destroying angel. 
#1 Co10-11: These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. 
#1 Co10-12: So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! 
#1 Co10-13: No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. 
#1 Co10-14: Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. 
#1 Co10-15: I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. 
#1 Co10-16: Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? 
#1 Co10-17: Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf. 
#1 Co10-18: Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? 
#1 Co10-19: Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
#1 Co10-20: No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. 
#1 Co10-21: You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons. 
#1 Co10-22: Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he? 
#1 Co10-23: "Everything is permissible"--but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible"--but not everything is constructive. 
#1 Co10-24: Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. 
#1 Co10-25: Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, 
#1 Co10-26: for, "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it." 
#1 Co10-27: If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. 
#1 Co10-28: But if anyone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience' sake-- 
#1 Co10-29: the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience? 
#1 Co10-30: If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for? 
#1 Co10-31: So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. 
#1 Co10-32: Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God-- 
#1 Co10-33: even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 11
#1 Co11-1: Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. 
#1 Co11-2: I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you. 
#1 Co11-3: But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, "and the head of Christ is God. 
#1 Co11-4: Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 
#1 Co11-5: But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head —it is the same as having her head shaved. 
#1 Co11-6: For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head. 
#1 Co11-7: A man ought not to cover his head, "since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 
#1 Co11-8: For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 
#1 Co11-9: neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 
#1 Co11-10: It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own "head, because of the angels. 
#1 Co11-11: Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
#1 Co11-12: For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. 
#1 Co11-13: Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
#1 Co11-14: Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 
#1 Co11-15: but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 
#1 Co11-16: If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice —nor do the churches of God. 
#1 Co11-17: In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 
#1 Co11-18: In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 
#1 Co11-19: No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. 
#1 Co11-20: So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, 
#1 Co11-21: for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. 
#1 Co11-22: Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter! 
#1 Co11-23: For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 
#1 Co11-24: and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me." 
#1 Co11-25: In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me." 
#1 Co11-26: For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. 
#1 Co11-27: So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 
#1 Co11-28: Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. 
#1 Co11-29: For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves. 
#1 Co11-30: That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 
#1 Co11-31: But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment. 
#1 Co11-32: Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world. 
#1 Co11-33: So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together. 
#1 Co11-34: Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 12
#1 Co12-1: Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. 
#1 Co12-2: You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. 
#1 Co12-3: Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit. 
#1 Co12-4: There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. 
#1 Co12-5: There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. 
#1 Co12-6: There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work. 
#1 Co12-7: Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. 
#1 Co12-8: To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, 
#1 Co12-9: to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, 
#1 Co12-10: to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, "and to still another the interpretation of tongues. [^2] 
#1 Co12-11: All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines. 
#1 Co12-12: Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. 
#1 Co12-13: For we were all baptized by "one Spirit so as to form one body —whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free —and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. 
#1 Co12-14: Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many. 
#1 Co12-15: Now if the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. 
#1 Co12-16: And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. 
#1 Co12-17: If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 
#1 Co12-18: But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. 
#1 Co12-19: If they were all one part, where would the body be? 
#1 Co12-20: As it is, there are many parts, but one body. 
#1 Co12-21: The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" 
#1 Co12-22: On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 
#1 Co12-23: and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, 
#1 Co12-24: while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, 
#1 Co12-25: so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. 
#1 Co12-26: If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. 
#1 Co12-27: Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. 
#1 Co12-28: And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues. 
#1 Co12-29: Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 
#1 Co12-30: Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues "? Do all interpret? 
#1 Co12-31: Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most excellent way.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 13
#1 Co13-1: If I speak in the tongues "of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 
#1 Co13-2: If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 
#1 Co13-3: If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, "but do not have love, I gain nothing. 
#1 Co13-4: Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
#1 Co13-5: It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
#1 Co13-6: Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
#1 Co13-7: It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 
#1 Co13-8: Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
#1 Co13-9: For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
#1 Co13-10: but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 
#1 Co13-11: When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 
#1 Co13-12: For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. 
#1 Co13-13: And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 14
#1 Co14-1: Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. 
#1 Co14-2: For anyone who speaks in a tongue "does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit. 
#1 Co14-3: But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. 
#1 Co14-4: Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 
#1 Co14-5: I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, "but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, "unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified. 
#1 Co14-6: Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? 
#1 Co14-7: Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? 
#1 Co14-8: Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 
#1 Co14-9: So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. 
#1 Co14-10: Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 
#1 Co14-11: If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. 
#1 Co14-12: So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church. 
#1 Co14-13: For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. 
#1 Co14-14: For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 
#1 Co14-15: So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. 
#1 Co14-16: Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, "say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? 
#1 Co14-17: You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified. 
#1 Co14-18: I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 
#1 Co14-19: But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. 
#1 Co14-20: Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. 
#1 Co14-21: In the Law it is written: "With other tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord." [^5] 
#1 Co14-22: Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. 
#1 Co14-23: So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 
#1 Co14-24: But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, 
#1 Co14-25: as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!" 
#1 Co14-26: What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. 
#1 Co14-27: If anyone speaks in a tongue, two —or at the most three —should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. 
#1 Co14-28: If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God. 
#1 Co14-29: Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. 
#1 Co14-30: And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. 
#1 Co14-31: For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. 
#1 Co14-32: The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. 
#1 Co14-33: For God is not a God of disorder but of peace —as in all the congregations of the Lord's people. 
#1 Co14-34: Women "should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. 
#1 Co14-35: If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. [^7] 
#1 Co14-36: Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? 
#1 Co14-37: If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command. 
#1 Co14-38: But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored. [^8] 
#1 Co14-39: Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 
#1 Co14-40: But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 15
#1 Co15-1: Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. 
#1 Co15-2: By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. 
#1 Co15-3: For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance ": that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 
#1 Co15-4: that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 
#1 Co15-5: and that he appeared to Cephas, "and then to the Twelve. 
#1 Co15-6: After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 
#1 Co15-7: Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 
#1 Co15-8: and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. 
#1 Co15-9: For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
#1 Co15-10: But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them —yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. 
#1 Co15-11: Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. 
#1 Co15-12: But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
#1 Co15-13: If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 
#1 Co15-14: And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 
#1 Co15-15: More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. 
#1 Co15-16: For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 
#1 Co15-17: And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. 
#1 Co15-18: Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. 
#1 Co15-19: If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied. 
#1 Co15-20: But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
#1 Co15-21: For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 
#1 Co15-22: For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. 
#1 Co15-23: But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. 
#1 Co15-24: Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. 
#1 Co15-25: For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
#1 Co15-26: The last enemy to be destroyed is death. 
#1 Co15-27: For he "has put everything under his feet." "Now when it says that "everything" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. 
#1 Co15-28: When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. 
#1 Co15-29: Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? 
#1 Co15-30: And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? 
#1 Co15-31: I face death every day —yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
#1 Co15-32: If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." [^4] 
#1 Co15-33: Do not be misled: "Bad company corrupts good character." [^5] 
#1 Co15-34: Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God —I say this to your shame. 
#1 Co15-35: But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?" 
#1 Co15-36: How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 
#1 Co15-37: When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 
#1 Co15-38: But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. 
#1 Co15-39: Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. 
#1 Co15-40: There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. 
#1 Co15-41: The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. 
#1 Co15-42: So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; 
#1 Co15-43: it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 
#1 Co15-44: it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 
#1 Co15-45: So it is written: "The first man Adam became a living being" "; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. 
#1 Co15-46: The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. 
#1 Co15-47: The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven. 
#1 Co15-48: As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. 
#1 Co15-49: And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we "bear the image of the heavenly man. 
#1 Co15-50: I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 
#1 Co15-51: Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed — 
#1 Co15-52: in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 
#1 Co15-53: For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. 
#1 Co15-54: When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: "Death has been swallowed up in victory." [^8] 
#1 Co15-55: "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?" [^9] 
#1 Co15-56: The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 
#1 Co15-57: But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#1 Co15-58: Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
 1 CORÍNTIOS 16
#1 Co16-1: Now about the collection for the Lord's people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do. 
#1 Co16-2: On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. 
#1 Co16-3: Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. 
#1 Co16-4: If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me. 
#1 Co16-5: After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you —for I will be going through Macedonia. 
#1 Co16-6: Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. 
#1 Co16-7: For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 
#1 Co16-8: But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, 
#1 Co16-9: because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me. 
#1 Co16-10: When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am. 
#1 Co16-11: No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers. 
#1 Co16-12: Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity. 
#1 Co16-13: Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong. 
#1 Co16-14: Do everything in love. 
#1 Co16-15: You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord's people. I urge you, brothers and sisters, 
#1 Co16-16: to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it. 
#1 Co16-17: I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. 
#1 Co16-18: For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition. 
#1 Co16-19: The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla "greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. 
#1 Co16-20: All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
#1 Co16-21: I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. 
#1 Co16-22: If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord "! 
#1 Co16-23: The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 
#1 Co16-24: My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen. [^3]
2 CORÍNTIOS
 2 CORÍNTIOS 1
#2 Co1-1: Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all his holy people throughout Achaia: 
#2 Co1-2: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
#2 Co1-3: Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 
#2 Co1-4: who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God. 
#2 Co1-5: For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ. 
#2 Co1-6: If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. 
#2 Co1-7: And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort. 
#2 Co1-8: We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, "about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself. 
#2 Co1-9: Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. 
#2 Co1-10: He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us, 
#2 Co1-11: as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many. 
#2 Co1-12: Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with integrity "and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom but on God's grace. 
#2 Co1-13: For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that, 
#2 Co1-14: as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
#2 Co1-15: Because I was confident of this, I wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice. 
#2 Co1-16: I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea. 
#2 Co1-17: Was I fickle when I intended to do this? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say both "Yes, yes" and "No, no"? 
#2 Co1-18: But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No." 
#2 Co1-19: For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us —by me and Silas "and Timothy —was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes." 
#2 Co1-20: For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God. 
#2 Co1-21: Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, 
#2 Co1-22: set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come. 
#2 Co1-23: I call God as my witness —and I stake my life on it —that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth. 
#2 Co1-24: Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 2
#2 Co2-1: So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you. 
#2 Co2-2: For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved? 
#2 Co2-3: I wrote as I did, so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy. 
#2 Co2-4: For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you. 
#2 Co2-5: If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent —not to put it too severely. 
#2 Co2-6: The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient. 
#2 Co2-7: Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 
#2 Co2-8: I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. 
#2 Co2-9: Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. 
#2 Co2-10: Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven —if there was anything to forgive —I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, 
#2 Co2-11: in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. 
#2 Co2-12: Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me, 
#2 Co2-13: I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia. 
#2 Co2-14: But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ's triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere. 
#2 Co2-15: For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. 
#2 Co2-16: To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task? 
#2 Co2-17: Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 3
#2 Co3-1: Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you? 
#2 Co3-2: You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone. 
#2 Co3-3: You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. 
#2 Co3-4: Such confidence we have through Christ before God. 
#2 Co3-5: Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. 
#2 Co3-6: He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant —not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. 
#2 Co3-7: Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was, 
#2 Co3-8: will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? 
#2 Co3-9: If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness! 
#2 Co3-10: For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory. 
#2 Co3-11: And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts! 
#2 Co3-12: Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. 
#2 Co3-13: We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away. 
#2 Co3-14: But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. 
#2 Co3-15: Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. 
#2 Co3-16: But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
#2 Co3-17: Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
#2 Co3-18: And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate "the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 4
#2 Co4-1: Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. 
#2 Co4-2: Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God. 
#2 Co4-3: And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 
#2 Co4-4: The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 
#2 Co4-5: For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. 
#2 Co4-6: For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," "made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory displayed in the face of Christ. 
#2 Co4-7: But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. 
#2 Co4-8: We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; 
#2 Co4-9: persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. 
#2 Co4-10: We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. 
#2 Co4-11: For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body. 
#2 Co4-12: So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. 
#2 Co4-13: It is written: "I believed; therefore I have spoken." "Since we have that same spirit of "faith, we also believe and therefore speak, 
#2 Co4-14: because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself. 
#2 Co4-15: All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God. 
#2 Co4-16: Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. 
#2 Co4-17: For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. 
#2 Co4-18: So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 5
#2 Co5-1: For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands. 
#2 Co5-2: Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, 
#2 Co5-3: because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked. 
#2 Co5-4: For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 
#2 Co5-5: Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come. 
#2 Co5-6: Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. 
#2 Co5-7: For we live by faith, not by sight. 
#2 Co5-8: We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. 
#2 Co5-9: So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it. 
#2 Co5-10: For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad. 
#2 Co5-11: Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience. 
#2 Co5-12: We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart. 
#2 Co5-13: If we are "out of our mind," as some say, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. 
#2 Co5-14: For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. 
#2 Co5-15: And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again. 
#2 Co5-16: So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. 
#2 Co5-17: Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: "The old has gone, the new is here! 
#2 Co5-18: All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 
#2 Co5-19: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 
#2 Co5-20: We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. 
#2 Co5-21: God made him who had no sin to be sin "for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 6
#2 Co6-1: As God's co-workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain. 
#2 Co6-2: For he says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you." "I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation. 
#2 Co6-3: We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited. 
#2 Co6-4: Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses; 
#2 Co6-5: in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger; 
#2 Co6-6: in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; 
#2 Co6-7: in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; 
#2 Co6-8: through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors; 
#2 Co6-9: known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed; 
#2 Co6-10: sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything. 
#2 Co6-11: We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you. 
#2 Co6-12: We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. 
#2 Co6-13: As a fair exchange —I speak as to my children —open wide your hearts also. 
#2 Co6-14: Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 
#2 Co6-15: What harmony is there between Christ and Belial "? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 
#2 Co6-16: What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people." [^3] 
#2 Co6-17: Therefore, "Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you." [^4] 
#2 Co6-18: And, "I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty." [^5]
 2 CORÍNTIOS 7
#2 Co7-1: Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God. 
#2 Co7-2: Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one. 
#2 Co7-3: I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you. 
#2 Co7-4: I have spoken to you with great frankness; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. 
#2 Co7-5: For when we came into Macedonia, we had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn —conflicts on the outside, fears within. 
#2 Co7-6: But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, 
#2 Co7-7: and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever. 
#2 Co7-8: Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it —I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while — 
#2 Co7-9: yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. 
#2 Co7-10: Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. 
#2 Co7-11: See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter. 
#2 Co7-12: So even though I wrote to you, it was neither on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are. 
#2 Co7-13: By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. 
#2 Co7-14: I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well. 
#2 Co7-15: And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling. 
#2 Co7-16: I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 8
#2 Co8-1: And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches. 
#2 Co8-2: In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. 
#2 Co8-3: For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own, 
#2 Co8-4: they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord's people. 
#2 Co8-5: And they exceeded our expectations: They gave themselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us. 
#2 Co8-6: So we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part. 
#2 Co8-7: But since you excel in everything —in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you "—see that you also excel in this grace of giving. 
#2 Co8-8: I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. 
#2 Co8-9: For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich. 
#2 Co8-10: And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter. Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so. 
#2 Co8-11: Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means. 
#2 Co8-12: For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have. 
#2 Co8-13: Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. 
#2 Co8-14: At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality, 
#2 Co8-15: as it is written: "The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little." [^2] 
#2 Co8-16: Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you. 
#2 Co8-17: For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative. 
#2 Co8-18: And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel. 
#2 Co8-19: What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help. 
#2 Co8-20: We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift. 
#2 Co8-21: For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man. 
#2 Co8-22: In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you. 
#2 Co8-23: As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ. 
#2 Co8-24: Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 9
#2 Co9-1: There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord's people. 
#2 Co9-2: For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action. 
#2 Co9-3: But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be. 
#2 Co9-4: For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we —not to say anything about you —would be ashamed of having been so confident. 
#2 Co9-5: So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given. 
#2 Co9-6: Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. 
#2 Co9-7: Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 
#2 Co9-8: And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. 
#2 Co9-9: As it is written: "They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their righteousness endures forever." [^1] 
#2 Co9-10: Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. 
#2 Co9-11: You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. 
#2 Co9-12: This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. 
#2 Co9-13: Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else. 
#2 Co9-14: And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you. 
#2 Co9-15: Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
 2 CORÍNTIOS 10
#2 Co10-1: By the humility and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you —I, Paul, who am "timid" when face to face with you, but "bold" toward you when away! 
#2 Co10-2: I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world. 
#2 Co10-3: For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. 
#2 Co10-4: The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. 
#2 Co10-5: We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. 
#2 Co10-6: And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete. 
#2 Co10-7: You are judging by appearances. "If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do. 
#2 Co10-8: So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it. 
#2 Co10-9: I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters. 
#2 Co10-10: For some say, "His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing." 
#2 Co10-11: Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present. 
#2 Co10-12: We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise. 
#2 Co10-13: We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us, a sphere that also includes you. 
#2 Co10-14: We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ. 
#2 Co10-15: Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand, 
#2 Co10-16: so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in someone else's territory. 
#2 Co10-17: But, "Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord." [^2] 
#2 Co10-18: For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 11
#2 Co11-1: I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness. Yes, please put up with me! 
#2 Co11-2: I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. 
#2 Co11-3: But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 
#2 Co11-4: For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. 
#2 Co11-5: I do not think I am in the least inferior to those "super-apostles." [^1] 
#2 Co11-6: I may indeed be untrained as a speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way. 
#2 Co11-7: Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? 
#2 Co11-8: I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. 
#2 Co11-9: And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. 
#2 Co11-10: As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. 
#2 Co11-11: Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! 
#2 Co11-12: And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. 
#2 Co11-13: For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 
#2 Co11-14: And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 
#2 Co11-15: It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve. 
#2 Co11-16: I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then tolerate me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting. 
#2 Co11-17: In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. 
#2 Co11-18: Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. 
#2 Co11-19: You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! 
#2 Co11-20: In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face. 
#2 Co11-21: To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! Whatever anyone else dares to boast about —I am speaking as a fool —I also dare to boast about. 
#2 Co11-22: Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. 
#2 Co11-23: Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. 
#2 Co11-24: Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. 
#2 Co11-25: Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, 
#2 Co11-26: I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers. 
#2 Co11-27: I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. 
#2 Co11-28: Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. 
#2 Co11-29: Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn? 
#2 Co11-30: If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. 
#2 Co11-31: The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. 
#2 Co11-32: In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. 
#2 Co11-33: But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 12
#2 Co12-1: I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. 
#2 Co12-2: I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know —God knows. 
#2 Co12-3: And I know that this man —whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows — 
#2 Co12-4: was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. 
#2 Co12-5: I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses. 
#2 Co12-6: Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say, 
#2 Co12-7: or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. 
#2 Co12-8: Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. 
#2 Co12-9: But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. 
#2 Co12-10: That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. 
#2 Co12-11: I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the "super-apostles," "even though I am nothing. 
#2 Co12-12: I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles. 
#2 Co12-13: How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! 
#2 Co12-14: Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. 
#2 Co12-15: So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less? 
#2 Co12-16: Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery! 
#2 Co12-17: Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you? 
#2 Co12-18: I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit? 
#2 Co12-19: Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening. 
#2 Co12-20: For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder. 
#2 Co12-21: I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.
 2 CORÍNTIOS 13
#2 Co13-1: This will be my third visit to you. "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." [^1] 
#2 Co13-2: I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others, 
#2 Co13-3: since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you. 
#2 Co13-4: For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God's power we will live with him in our dealing with you. 
#2 Co13-5: Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you —unless, of course, you fail the test? 
#2 Co13-6: And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test. 
#2 Co13-7: Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong —not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed. 
#2 Co13-8: For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. 
#2 Co13-9: We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is that you may be fully restored. 
#2 Co13-10: This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority —the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down. 
#2 Co13-11: Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you. 
#2 Co13-12: Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
#2 Co13-13: All God's people here send their greetings. 
#2 Co13-14: May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
GÁLATAS
 GÁLATAS 1
#Gl1-1: Paul, an apostle —sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead — 
#Gl1-2: and all the brothers and sisters "with me, To the churches in Galatia: 
#Gl1-3: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
#Gl1-4: who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 
#Gl1-5: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
#Gl1-6: I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel — 
#Gl1-7: which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 
#Gl1-8: But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse! 
#Gl1-9: As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God's curse! 
#Gl1-10: Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ. 
#Gl1-11: I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. 
#Gl1-12: I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. 
#Gl1-13: For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. 
#Gl1-14: I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 
#Gl1-15: But when God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, was pleased 
#Gl1-16: to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. 
#Gl1-17: I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus. 
#Gl1-18: Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas "and stayed with him fifteen days. 
#Gl1-19: I saw none of the other apostles —only James, the Lord's brother. 
#Gl1-20: I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. 
#Gl1-21: Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. 
#Gl1-22: I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. 
#Gl1-23: They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy." 
#Gl1-24: And they praised God because of me.
 GÁLATAS 2
#Gl2-1: Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also. 
#Gl2-2: I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain. 
#Gl2-3: Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. 
#Gl2-4: This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. 
#Gl2-5: We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. 
#Gl2-6: As for those who were held in high esteem —whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism —they added nothing to my message. 
#Gl2-7: On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, "just as Peter had been to the circumcised. [^2] 
#Gl2-8: For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles. 
#Gl2-9: James, Cephas "and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised. 
#Gl2-10: All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along. 
#Gl2-11: When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. 
#Gl2-12: For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. 
#Gl2-13: The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. 
#Gl2-14: When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs? 
#Gl2-15: "We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles 
#Gl2-16: know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in "Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. 
#Gl2-17: "But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn't that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! 
#Gl2-18: If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker. 
#Gl2-19: "For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. 
#Gl2-20: I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 
#Gl2-21: I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!" [^5]
 GÁLATAS 3
#Gl3-1: You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. 
#Gl3-2: I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? 
#Gl3-3: Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh? [^1] 
#Gl3-4: Have you experienced "so much in vain —if it really was in vain? 
#Gl3-5: So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? 
#Gl3-6: So also Abraham "believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." [^3] 
#Gl3-7: Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. 
#Gl3-8: Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: "All nations will be blessed through you." [^4] 
#Gl3-9: So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. 
#Gl3-10: For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law." [^5] 
#Gl3-11: Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because "the righteous will live by faith." [^6] 
#Gl3-12: The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, "The person who does these things will live by them." [^7] 
#Gl3-13: Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole." [^8] 
#Gl3-14: He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit. 
#Gl3-15: Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. 
#Gl3-16: The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," "meaning one person, who is Christ. 
#Gl3-17: What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. 
#Gl3-18: For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise. 
#Gl3-19: Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator. 
#Gl3-20: A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one. 
#Gl3-21: Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. 
#Gl3-22: But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. 
#Gl3-23: Before the coming of this faith, "we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. 
#Gl3-24: So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. 
#Gl3-25: Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. 
#Gl3-26: So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 
#Gl3-27: for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 
#Gl3-28: There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 
#Gl3-29: If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
 GÁLATAS 4
#Gl4-1: What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. 
#Gl4-2: The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. 
#Gl4-3: So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces "of the world. 
#Gl4-4: But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 
#Gl4-5: to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship. [^2] 
#Gl4-6: Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, , "Father." 
#Gl4-7: So you are no longer a slave, but God's child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir. 
#Gl4-8: Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. 
#Gl4-9: But now that you know God —or rather are known by God —how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces "? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? 
#Gl4-10: You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! 
#Gl4-11: I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you. 
#Gl4-12: I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong. 
#Gl4-13: As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you, 
#Gl4-14: and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. 
#Gl4-15: Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. 
#Gl4-16: Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? 
#Gl4-17: Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them. 
#Gl4-18: It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you. 
#Gl4-19: My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, 
#Gl4-20: how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you! 
#Gl4-21: Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? 
#Gl4-22: For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. 
#Gl4-23: His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise. 
#Gl4-24: These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. 
#Gl4-25: Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. 
#Gl4-26: But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. 
#Gl4-27: For it is written: "Be glad, barren woman, you who never bore a child; shout for joy and cry aloud, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband." [^5] 
#Gl4-28: Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. 
#Gl4-29: At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. 
#Gl4-30: But what does Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son." [^6] 
#Gl4-31: Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
 GÁLATAS 5
#Gl5-1: It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. 
#Gl5-2: Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. 
#Gl5-3: Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. 
#Gl5-4: You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. 
#Gl5-5: For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope. 
#Gl5-6: For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. 
#Gl5-7: You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth? 
#Gl5-8: That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. 
#Gl5-9: "A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough." 
#Gl5-10: I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty. 
#Gl5-11: Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. 
#Gl5-12: As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! 
#Gl5-13: You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh "; rather, serve one another humbly in love. 
#Gl5-14: For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." [^2] 
#Gl5-15: If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. 
#Gl5-16: So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 
#Gl5-17: For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever "you want. 
#Gl5-18: But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 
#Gl5-19: The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 
#Gl5-20: idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 
#Gl5-21: and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. 
#Gl5-22: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
#Gl5-23: gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 
#Gl5-24: Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 
#Gl5-25: Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. 
#Gl5-26: Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
 GÁLATAS 6
#Gl6-1: Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted. 
#Gl6-2: Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. 
#Gl6-3: If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves. 
#Gl6-4: Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else, 
#Gl6-5: for each one should carry their own load. 
#Gl6-6: Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor. 
#Gl6-7: Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. 
#Gl6-8: Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. 
#Gl6-9: Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. 
#Gl6-10: Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. 
#Gl6-11: See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand! 
#Gl6-12: Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
#Gl6-13: Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh. 
#Gl6-14: May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which "the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
#Gl6-15: Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation. 
#Gl6-16: Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule —to "the Israel of God. 
#Gl6-17: From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. 
#Gl6-18: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
EFÉSIOS
 EFÉSIOS 1
#Ef1-1: Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To God's holy people in Ephesus, "the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
#Ef1-2: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
#Ef1-3: Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. 
#Ef1-4: For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love 
#Ef1-5: he "predestined us for adoption to sonship "through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will — 
#Ef1-6: to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. 
#Ef1-7: In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace 
#Ef1-8: that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, 
#Ef1-9: he "made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, 
#Ef1-10: to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment —to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ. 
#Ef1-11: In him we were also chosen, "having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, 
#Ef1-12: in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. 
#Ef1-13: And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, 
#Ef1-14: who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession —to the praise of his glory. 
#Ef1-15: For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people, 
#Ef1-16: I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. 
#Ef1-17: I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit "of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. 
#Ef1-18: I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, 
#Ef1-19: and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength 
#Ef1-20: he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, 
#Ef1-21: far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. 
#Ef1-22: And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, 
#Ef1-23: which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
 EFÉSIOS 2
#Ef2-1: As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, 
#Ef2-2: in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. 
#Ef2-3: All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh "and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. 
#Ef2-4: But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 
#Ef2-5: made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions —it is by grace you have been saved. 
#Ef2-6: And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 
#Ef2-7: in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 
#Ef2-8: For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith —and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God — 
#Ef2-9: not by works, so that no one can boast. 
#Ef2-10: For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. 
#Ef2-11: Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (which is done in the body by human hands) — 
#Ef2-12: remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. 
#Ef2-13: But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 
#Ef2-14: For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 
#Ef2-15: by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace, 
#Ef2-16: and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility. 
#Ef2-17: He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. 
#Ef2-18: For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit. 
#Ef2-19: Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household, 
#Ef2-20: built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. 
#Ef2-21: In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. 
#Ef2-22: And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
 EFÉSIOS 3
#Ef3-1: For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles — 
#Ef3-2: Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you, 
#Ef3-3: that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. 
#Ef3-4: In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 
#Ef3-5: which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets. 
#Ef3-6: This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus. 
#Ef3-7: I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power. 
#Ef3-8: Although I am less than the least of all the Lord's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, 
#Ef3-9: and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. 
#Ef3-10: His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, 
#Ef3-11: according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
#Ef3-12: In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence. 
#Ef3-13: I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. 
#Ef3-14: For this reason I kneel before the Father, 
#Ef3-15: from whom every family "in heaven and on earth derives its name. 
#Ef3-16: I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 
#Ef3-17: so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 
#Ef3-18: may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 
#Ef3-19: and to know this love that surpasses knowledge —that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. 
#Ef3-20: Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, 
#Ef3-21: to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
 EFÉSIOS 4
#Ef4-1: As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 
#Ef4-2: Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 
#Ef4-3: Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. 
#Ef4-4: There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 
#Ef4-5: one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 
#Ef4-6: one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. 
#Ef4-7: But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. 
#Ef4-8: This is why it "says: "When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people." [^2] 
#Ef4-9: (What does "he ascended" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions "? 
#Ef4-10: He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) 
#Ef4-11: So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 
#Ef4-12: to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 
#Ef4-13: until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. 
#Ef4-14: Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. 
#Ef4-15: Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. 
#Ef4-16: From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. 
#Ef4-17: So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 
#Ef4-18: They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 
#Ef4-19: Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed. 
#Ef4-20: That, however, is not the way of life you learned 
#Ef4-21: when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. 
#Ef4-22: You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 
#Ef4-23: to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 
#Ef4-24: and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. 
#Ef4-25: Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body. 
#Ef4-26: "In your anger do not sin" ": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, 
#Ef4-27: and do not give the devil a foothold. 
#Ef4-28: Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need. 
#Ef4-29: Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. 
#Ef4-30: And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 
#Ef4-31: Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. 
#Ef4-32: Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
 EFÉSIOS 5
#Ef5-1: Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children 
#Ef5-2: and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. 
#Ef5-3: But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people. 
#Ef5-4: Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. 
#Ef5-5: For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person —such a person is an idolater —has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. [^1] 
#Ef5-6: Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient. 
#Ef5-7: Therefore do not be partners with them. 
#Ef5-8: For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light 
#Ef5-9: (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) 
#Ef5-10: and find out what pleases the Lord. 
#Ef5-11: Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. 
#Ef5-12: It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 
#Ef5-13: But everything exposed by the light becomes visible —and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. 
#Ef5-14: This is why it is said: "Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." 
#Ef5-15: Be very careful, then, how you live —not as unwise but as wise, 
#Ef5-16: making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. 
#Ef5-17: Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. 
#Ef5-18: Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, 
#Ef5-19: speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, 
#Ef5-20: always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#Ef5-21: Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. 
#Ef5-22: Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 
#Ef5-23: For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 
#Ef5-24: Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 
#Ef5-25: Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 
#Ef5-26: to make her holy, cleansing "her by the washing with water through the word, 
#Ef5-27: and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 
#Ef5-28: In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 
#Ef5-29: After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church — 
#Ef5-30: for we are members of his body. 
#Ef5-31: "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." [^3] 
#Ef5-32: This is a profound mystery —but I am talking about Christ and the church. 
#Ef5-33: However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
 EFÉSIOS 6
#Ef6-1: Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 
#Ef6-2: "Honor your father and mother" —which is the first commandment with a promise — 
#Ef6-3: "so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth." [^1] 
#Ef6-4: Fathers, "do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. 
#Ef6-5: Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 
#Ef6-6: Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. 
#Ef6-7: Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, 
#Ef6-8: because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free. 
#Ef6-9: And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him. 
#Ef6-10: Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 
#Ef6-11: Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 
#Ef6-12: For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 
#Ef6-13: Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 
#Ef6-14: Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 
#Ef6-15: and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 
#Ef6-16: In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 
#Ef6-17: Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 
#Ef6-18: And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people. 
#Ef6-19: Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, 
#Ef6-20: for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should. 
#Ef6-21: Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing. 
#Ef6-22: I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you. 
#Ef6-23: Peace to the brothers and sisters, "and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
#Ef6-24: Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love. [^4]

 FILIPENSES 1
#Fp1-1: Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all God's holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons ": 
#Fp1-2: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
#Fp1-3: I thank my God every time I remember you. 
#Fp1-4: In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy 
#Fp1-5: because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, 
#Fp1-6: being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. 
#Fp1-7: It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me. 
#Fp1-8: God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. 
#Fp1-9: And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, 
#Fp1-10: so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 
#Fp1-11: filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ —to the glory and praise of God. 
#Fp1-12: Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, "that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. 
#Fp1-13: As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard "and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. 
#Fp1-14: And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear. 
#Fp1-15: It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 
#Fp1-16: The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. 
#Fp1-17: The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. 
#Fp1-18: But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, 
#Fp1-19: for I know that through your prayers and God's provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance. [^4] 
#Fp1-20: I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. 
#Fp1-21: For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 
#Fp1-22: If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! 
#Fp1-23: I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; 
#Fp1-24: but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. 
#Fp1-25: Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 
#Fp1-26: so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me. 
#Fp1-27: Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, "striving together as one for the faith of the gospel 
#Fp1-28: without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved —and that by God. 
#Fp1-29: For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, 
#Fp1-30: since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
 FILIPENSES 2
#Fp2-1: Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, 
#Fp2-2: then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. 
#Fp2-3: Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, 
#Fp2-4: not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. 
#Fp2-5: In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: 
#Fp2-6: Who, being in very nature "God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; 
#Fp2-7: rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature "of a servant, being made in human likeness. 
#Fp2-8: And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death — even death on a cross! 
#Fp2-9: Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, 
#Fp2-10: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 
#Fp2-11: and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 
#Fp2-12: Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed —not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence —continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, 
#Fp2-13: for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose. 
#Fp2-14: Do everything without grumbling or arguing, 
#Fp2-15: so that you may become blameless and pure, "children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation." "Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky 
#Fp2-16: as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. 
#Fp2-17: But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. 
#Fp2-18: So you too should be glad and rejoice with me. 
#Fp2-19: I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you. 
#Fp2-20: I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. 
#Fp2-21: For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 
#Fp2-22: But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. 
#Fp2-23: I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. 
#Fp2-24: And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon. 
#Fp2-25: But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. 
#Fp2-26: For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. 
#Fp2-27: Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. 
#Fp2-28: Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. 
#Fp2-29: So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, 
#Fp2-30: because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.
 FILIPENSES 3
#Fp3-1: Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. 
#Fp3-2: Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. 
#Fp3-3: For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh — 
#Fp3-4: though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: 
#Fp3-5: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; 
#Fp3-6: as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless. 
#Fp3-7: But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 
#Fp3-8: What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ 
#Fp3-9: and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in "Christ —the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. 
#Fp3-10: I want to know Christ —yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 
#Fp3-11: and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. 
#Fp3-12: Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 
#Fp3-13: Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 
#Fp3-14: I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. 
#Fp3-15: All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. 
#Fp3-16: Only let us live up to what we have already attained. 
#Fp3-17: Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. 
#Fp3-18: For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 
#Fp3-19: Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. 
#Fp3-20: But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
#Fp3-21: who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
 FILIPENSES 4
#Fp4-1: Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends! 
#Fp4-2: I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. 
#Fp4-3: Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life. 
#Fp4-4: Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 
#Fp4-5: Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. 
#Fp4-6: Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 
#Fp4-7: And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. 
#Fp4-8: Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable —if anything is excellent or praiseworthy —think about such things. 
#Fp4-9: Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me —put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. 
#Fp4-10: I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 
#Fp4-11: I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 
#Fp4-12: I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 
#Fp4-13: I can do all this through him who gives me strength. 
#Fp4-14: Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. 
#Fp4-15: Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; 
#Fp4-16: for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. 
#Fp4-17: Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. 
#Fp4-18: I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 
#Fp4-19: And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. 
#Fp4-20: To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
#Fp4-21: Greet all God's people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings. 
#Fp4-22: All God's people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household. 
#Fp4-23: The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. [^1]

 COLOSSENSES 1
#Cl1-1: Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 
#Cl1-2: To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse: Grace and peace to you from God our Father. 
#Cl1-3: We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, 
#Cl1-4: because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints-- 
#Cl1-5: the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel 
#Cl1-6: that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth. 
#Cl1-7: You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, 
#Cl1-8: and who also told us of your love in the Spirit. 
#Cl1-9: For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. 
#Cl1-10: And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, 
#Cl1-11: being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully 
#Cl1-12: giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. 
#Cl1-13: For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, 
#Cl1-14: in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. 
#Cl1-15: He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 
#Cl1-16: For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. 
#Cl1-17: He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. 
#Cl1-18: And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. 
#Cl1-19: For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 
#Cl1-20: and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. 
#Cl1-21: Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. 
#Cl1-22: But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation-- 
#Cl1-23: if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. 
#Cl1-24: Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. 
#Cl1-25: I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness-- 
#Cl1-26: the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints. 
#Cl1-27: To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. 
#Cl1-28: We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. 
#Cl1-29: To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.
 COLOSSENSES 2
#Cl2-1: I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally. 
#Cl2-2: My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, 
#Cl2-3: in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
#Cl2-4: I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. 
#Cl2-5: For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is. 
#Cl2-6: So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, 
#Cl2-7: rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. 
#Cl2-8: See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces "of this world rather than on Christ. 
#Cl2-9: For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, 
#Cl2-10: and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority. 
#Cl2-11: In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh "was put off when you were circumcised by "Christ, 
#Cl2-12: having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. 
#Cl2-13: When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you "alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, 
#Cl2-14: having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. 
#Cl2-15: And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. [^5] 
#Cl2-16: Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. 
#Cl2-17: These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. 
#Cl2-18: Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind. 
#Cl2-19: They have lost connection with the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. 
#Cl2-20: Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules: 
#Cl2-21: "Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"? 
#Cl2-22: These rules, which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use, are based on merely human commands and teachings. 
#Cl2-23: Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
 COLOSSENSES 3
#Cl3-1: Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
#Cl3-2: Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 
#Cl3-3: For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 
#Cl3-4: When Christ, who is your "life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. 
#Cl3-5: Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 
#Cl3-6: Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. [^2] 
#Cl3-7: You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 
#Cl3-8: But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 
#Cl3-9: Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 
#Cl3-10: and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 
#Cl3-11: Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all. 
#Cl3-12: Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 
#Cl3-13: Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 
#Cl3-14: And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. 
#Cl3-15: Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. 
#Cl3-16: Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 
#Cl3-17: And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. 
#Cl3-18: Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
#Cl3-19: Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. 
#Cl3-20: Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. 
#Cl3-21: Fathers, "do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. 
#Cl3-22: Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. 
#Cl3-23: Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, 
#Cl3-24: since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. 
#Cl3-25: Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism.
 COLOSSENSES 4
#Cl4-1: Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven. 
#Cl4-2: Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. 
#Cl4-3: And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. 
#Cl4-4: Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. 
#Cl4-5: Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. 
#Cl4-6: Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone. 
#Cl4-7: Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant "in the Lord. 
#Cl4-8: I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our "circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts. 
#Cl4-9: He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here. 
#Cl4-10: My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.) 
#Cl4-11: Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews "among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me. 
#Cl4-12: Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured. 
#Cl4-13: I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis. 
#Cl4-14: Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings. 
#Cl4-15: Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house. 
#Cl4-16: After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea. 
#Cl4-17: Tell Archippus: "See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord." 
#Cl4-18: I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.

 1 TESSALONICENSES 1
#1 Ts1-1: Paul, Silas "and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you. 
#1 Ts1-2: We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers. 
#1 Ts1-3: We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#1 Ts1-4: For we know, brothers and sisters "loved by God, that he has chosen you, 
#1 Ts1-5: because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake. 
#1 Ts1-6: You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit. 
#1 Ts1-7: And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. 
#1 Ts1-8: The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia —your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it, 
#1 Ts1-9: for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 
#1 Ts1-10: and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead —Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
 1 TESSALONICENSES 2
#1 Ts2-1: You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results. 
#1 Ts2-2: We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition. 
#1 Ts2-3: For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you. 
#1 Ts2-4: On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please people but God, who tests our hearts. 
#1 Ts2-5: You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed —God is our witness. 
#1 Ts2-6: We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else, even though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority. 
#1 Ts2-7: Instead, we were like young children "among you. Just as a nursing mother cares for her children, 
#1 Ts2-8: so we cared for you. Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well. 
#1 Ts2-9: Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you. 
#1 Ts2-10: You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed. 
#1 Ts2-11: For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, 
#1 Ts2-12: encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory. 
#1 Ts2-13: And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe. 
#1 Ts2-14: For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews 
#1 Ts2-15: who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone 
#1 Ts2-16: in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last. [^2] 
#1 Ts2-17: But, brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you. 
#1 Ts2-18: For we wanted to come to you —certainly I, Paul, did, again and again —but Satan blocked our way. 
#1 Ts2-19: For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you? 
#1 Ts2-20: Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
 1 TESSALONICENSES 3
#1 Ts3-1: So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens. 
#1 Ts3-2: We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God's service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith, 
#1 Ts3-3: so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. For you know quite well that we are destined for them. 
#1 Ts3-4: In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know. 
#1 Ts3-5: For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain. 
#1 Ts3-6: But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you. 
#1 Ts3-7: Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith. 
#1 Ts3-8: For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord. 
#1 Ts3-9: How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you? 
#1 Ts3-10: Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith. 
#1 Ts3-11: Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you. 
#1 Ts3-12: May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you. 
#1 Ts3-13: May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
 1 TESSALONICENSES 4
#1 Ts4-1: As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more. 
#1 Ts4-2: For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus. 
#1 Ts4-3: It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; 
#1 Ts4-4: that each of you should learn to control your own body "in a way that is holy and honorable, 
#1 Ts4-5: not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God; 
#1 Ts4-6: and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. "The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before. 
#1 Ts4-7: For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. 
#1 Ts4-8: Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit. 
#1 Ts4-9: Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. 
#1 Ts4-10: And in fact, you do love all of God's family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, 
#1 Ts4-11: and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, 
#1 Ts4-12: so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody. 
#1 Ts4-13: Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope. 
#1 Ts4-14: For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. 
#1 Ts4-15: According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. 
#1 Ts4-16: For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 
#1 Ts4-17: After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. 
#1 Ts4-18: Therefore encourage one another with these words.
 1 TESSALONICENSES 5
#1 Ts5-1: Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, 
#1 Ts5-2: for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 
#1 Ts5-3: While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. 
#1 Ts5-4: But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. 
#1 Ts5-5: You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 
#1 Ts5-6: So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. 
#1 Ts5-7: For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 
#1 Ts5-8: But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. 
#1 Ts5-9: For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#1 Ts5-10: He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. 
#1 Ts5-11: Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. 
#1 Ts5-12: Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. 
#1 Ts5-13: Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. 
#1 Ts5-14: And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 
#1 Ts5-15: Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else. 
#1 Ts5-16: Rejoice always, 
#1 Ts5-17: pray continually, 
#1 Ts5-18: give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 
#1 Ts5-19: Do not quench the Spirit. 
#1 Ts5-20: Do not treat prophecies with contempt 
#1 Ts5-21: but test them all; hold on to what is good, 
#1 Ts5-22: reject every kind of evil. 
#1 Ts5-23: May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#1 Ts5-24: The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it. 
#1 Ts5-25: Brothers and sisters, pray for us. 
#1 Ts5-26: Greet all God's people with a holy kiss. 
#1 Ts5-27: I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters. 
#1 Ts5-28: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2 TESSALONICENSES
 2 TESSALONICENSES 1
#2 Ts1-1: Paul, Silas "and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
#2 Ts1-2: Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
#2 Ts1-3: We ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, "and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love all of you have for one another is increasing. 
#2 Ts1-4: Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring. 
#2 Ts1-5: All this is evidence that God's judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering. 
#2 Ts1-6: God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you 
#2 Ts1-7: and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels. 
#2 Ts1-8: He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
#2 Ts1-9: They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might 
#2 Ts1-10: on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you. 
#2 Ts1-11: With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith. 
#2 Ts1-12: We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. [^3]
 2 TESSALONICENSES 2
#2 Ts2-1: Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, 
#2 Ts2-2: not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us —whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter —asserting that the day of the Lord has already come. 
#2 Ts2-3: Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness "is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. 
#2 Ts2-4: He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God. 
#2 Ts2-5: Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? 
#2 Ts2-6: And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. 
#2 Ts2-7: For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. 
#2 Ts2-8: And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. 
#2 Ts2-9: The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, 
#2 Ts2-10: and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 
#2 Ts2-11: For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 
#2 Ts2-12: and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness. 
#2 Ts2-13: But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits "to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. 
#2 Ts2-14: He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#2 Ts2-15: So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings "we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter. 
#2 Ts2-16: May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope, 
#2 Ts2-17: encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
1 TIMÓTEO
 1 TIMÓTEO 1
#1 Tm1-1: Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, 
#1 Tm1-2: To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
#1 Tm1-3: As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer 
#1 Tm1-4: or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God's work —which is by faith. 
#1 Tm1-5: The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. 
#1 Tm1-6: Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk. 
#1 Tm1-7: They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm. 
#1 Tm1-8: We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. 
#1 Tm1-9: We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 
#1 Tm1-10: for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers —and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine 
#1 Tm1-11: that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me. 
#1 Tm1-12: I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. 
#1 Tm1-13: Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. 
#1 Tm1-14: The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 
#1 Tm1-15: Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners —of whom I am the worst. 
#1 Tm1-16: But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. 
#1 Tm1-17: Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
#1 Tm1-18: Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well, 
#1 Tm1-19: holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith. 
#1 Tm1-20: Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
 1 TIMÓTEO 2
#1 Tm2-1: I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people — 
#1 Tm2-2: for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 
#1 Tm2-3: This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 
#1 Tm2-4: who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
#1 Tm2-5: For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 
#1 Tm2-6: who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. 
#1 Tm2-7: And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle —I am telling the truth, I am not lying —and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles. 
#1 Tm2-8: Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. 
#1 Tm2-9: I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 
#1 Tm2-10: but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. 
#1 Tm2-11: A woman "should learn in quietness and full submission. 
#1 Tm2-12: I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; "she must be quiet. 
#1 Tm2-13: For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
#1 Tm2-14: And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 
#1 Tm2-15: But women "will be saved through childbearing —if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.
 1 TIMÓTEO 3
#1 Tm3-1: Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. 
#1 Tm3-2: Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 
#1 Tm3-3: not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 
#1 Tm3-4: He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full "respect. 
#1 Tm3-5: (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?) 
#1 Tm3-6: He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 
#1 Tm3-7: He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap. 
#1 Tm3-8: In the same way, deacons "are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 
#1 Tm3-9: They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 
#1 Tm3-10: They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. 
#1 Tm3-11: In the same way, the women "are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. 
#1 Tm3-12: A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. 
#1 Tm3-13: Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. 
#1 Tm3-14: Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, 
#1 Tm3-15: if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. 
#1 Tm3-16: Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, "was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.
 1 TIMÓTEO 4
#1 Tm4-1: The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. 
#1 Tm4-2: Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. 
#1 Tm4-3: They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. 
#1 Tm4-4: For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 
#1 Tm4-5: because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer. 
#1 Tm4-6: If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, "you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. 
#1 Tm4-7: Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. 
#1 Tm4-8: For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. 
#1 Tm4-9: This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance. 
#1 Tm4-10: That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe. 
#1 Tm4-11: Command and teach these things. 
#1 Tm4-12: Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity. 
#1 Tm4-13: Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. 
#1 Tm4-14: Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you. 
#1 Tm4-15: Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. 
#1 Tm4-16: Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
 1 TIMÓTEO 5
#1 Tm5-1: Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, 
#1 Tm5-2: older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity. 
#1 Tm5-3: Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. 
#1 Tm5-4: But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. 
#1 Tm5-5: The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. 
#1 Tm5-6: But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. 
#1 Tm5-7: Give the people these instructions, so that no one may be open to blame. 
#1 Tm5-8: Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 
#1 Tm5-9: No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, 
#1 Tm5-10: and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord's people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds. 
#1 Tm5-11: As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. 
#1 Tm5-12: Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. 
#1 Tm5-13: Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to. 
#1 Tm5-14: So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. 
#1 Tm5-15: Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan. 
#1 Tm5-16: If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need. 
#1 Tm5-17: The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. 
#1 Tm5-18: For Scripture says, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," "and "The worker deserves his wages." [^2] 
#1 Tm5-19: Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. 
#1 Tm5-20: But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning. 
#1 Tm5-21: I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism. 
#1 Tm5-22: Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. 
#1 Tm5-23: Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. 
#1 Tm5-24: The sins of some are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. 
#1 Tm5-25: In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden forever.
 1 TIMÓTEO 6
#1 Tm6-1: All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God's name and our teaching may not be slandered. 
#1 Tm6-2: Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare "of their slaves. These are the things you are to teach and insist on. 
#1 Tm6-3: If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 
#1 Tm6-4: they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions 
#1 Tm6-5: and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain. 
#1 Tm6-6: But godliness with contentment is great gain. 
#1 Tm6-7: For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. 
#1 Tm6-8: But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 
#1 Tm6-9: Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 
#1 Tm6-10: For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. 
#1 Tm6-11: But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. 
#1 Tm6-12: Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 
#1 Tm6-13: In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you 
#1 Tm6-14: to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
#1 Tm6-15: which God will bring about in his own time —God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 
#1 Tm6-16: who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen. 
#1 Tm6-17: Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 
#1 Tm6-18: Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. 
#1 Tm6-19: In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life. 
#1 Tm6-20: Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, 
#1 Tm6-21: which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith. Grace be with you all.
2 TIMÓTEO
 2 TIMÓTEO 1
#2 Tm1-1: Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, 
#2 Tm1-2: To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
#2 Tm1-3: I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. 
#2 Tm1-4: Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. 
#2 Tm1-5: I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also. 
#2 Tm1-6: For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
#2 Tm1-7: For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. 
#2 Tm1-8: So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. 
#2 Tm1-9: He has saved us and called us to a holy life —not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, 
#2 Tm1-10: but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 
#2 Tm1-11: And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. 
#2 Tm1-12: That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. 
#2 Tm1-13: What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. 
#2 Tm1-14: Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you —guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 
#2 Tm1-15: You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
#2 Tm1-16: May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. 
#2 Tm1-17: On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me. 
#2 Tm1-18: May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
 2 TIMÓTEO 2
#2 Tm2-1: You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
#2 Tm2-2: And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. 
#2 Tm2-3: Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
#2 Tm2-4: No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer. 
#2 Tm2-5: Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor's crown except by competing according to the rules. 
#2 Tm2-6: The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. 
#2 Tm2-7: Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this. 
#2 Tm2-8: Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, 
#2 Tm2-9: for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained. 
#2 Tm2-10: Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. 
#2 Tm2-11: Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him; 
#2 Tm2-12: if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us; 
#2 Tm2-13: if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself. 
#2 Tm2-14: Keep reminding God's people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. 
#2 Tm2-15: Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. 
#2 Tm2-16: Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. 
#2 Tm2-17: Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
#2 Tm2-18: who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. 
#2 Tm2-19: Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness." 
#2 Tm2-20: In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use. 
#2 Tm2-21: Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work. 
#2 Tm2-22: Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
#2 Tm2-23: Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. 
#2 Tm2-24: And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. 
#2 Tm2-25: Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, 
#2 Tm2-26: and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
 2 TIMÓTEO 3
#2 Tm3-1: But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 
#2 Tm3-2: People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
#2 Tm3-3: without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 
#2 Tm3-4: treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God — 
#2 Tm3-5: having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. 
#2 Tm3-6: They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, 
#2 Tm3-7: always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
#2 Tm3-8: Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected. 
#2 Tm3-9: But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone. 
#2 Tm3-10: You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 
#2 Tm3-11: persecutions, sufferings —what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them. 
#2 Tm3-12: In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 
#2 Tm3-13: while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
#2 Tm3-14: But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, 
#2 Tm3-15: and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
#2 Tm3-16: All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 
#2 Tm3-17: so that the servant of God "may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
 2 TIMÓTEO 4
#2 Tm4-1: In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: 
#2 Tm4-2: Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage —with great patience and careful instruction. 
#2 Tm4-3: For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 
#2 Tm4-4: They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 
#2 Tm4-5: But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry. 
#2 Tm4-6: For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. 
#2 Tm4-7: I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
#2 Tm4-8: Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day —and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. 
#2 Tm4-9: Do your best to come to me quickly, 
#2 Tm4-10: for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 
#2 Tm4-11: Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. 
#2 Tm4-12: I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
#2 Tm4-13: When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments. 
#2 Tm4-14: Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. 
#2 Tm4-15: You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message. 
#2 Tm4-16: At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. 
#2 Tm4-17: But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth. 
#2 Tm4-18: The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
#2 Tm4-19: Greet Priscilla "and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. 
#2 Tm4-20: Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. 
#2 Tm4-21: Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers and sisters. [^2] 
#2 Tm4-22: The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
TITO
 TITO 1
#Tt1-1: Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness — 
#Tt1-2: in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time, 
#Tt1-3: and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior, 
#Tt1-4: To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. 
#Tt1-5: The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint "elders in every town, as I directed you. 
#Tt1-6: An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe "and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient. 
#Tt1-7: Since an overseer manages God's household, he must be blameless —not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. 
#Tt1-8: Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined. 
#Tt1-9: He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. 
#Tt1-10: For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group. 
#Tt1-11: They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach —and that for the sake of dishonest gain. 
#Tt1-12: One of Crete's own prophets has said it: "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons." [^3] 
#Tt1-13: This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith 
#Tt1-14: and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth. 
#Tt1-15: To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted. 
#Tt1-16: They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.
 TITO 2
#Tt2-1: You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine. 
#Tt2-2: Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance. 
#Tt2-3: Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. 
#Tt2-4: Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, 
#Tt2-5: to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God. 
#Tt2-6: Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. 
#Tt2-7: In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness 
#Tt2-8: and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us. 
#Tt2-9: Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, 
#Tt2-10: and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive. 
#Tt2-11: For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. 
#Tt2-12: It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, 
#Tt2-13: while we wait for the blessed hope —the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, 
#Tt2-14: who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good. 
#Tt2-15: These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
 TITO 3
#Tt3-1: Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good, 
#Tt3-2: to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone. 
#Tt3-3: At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. 
#Tt3-4: But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, 
#Tt3-5: he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 
#Tt3-6: whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
#Tt3-7: so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. 
#Tt3-8: This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone. 
#Tt3-9: But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. 
#Tt3-10: Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them. 
#Tt3-11: You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned. 
#Tt3-12: As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there. 
#Tt3-13: Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need. 
#Tt3-14: Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives. 
#Tt3-15: Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.

#Fm1-1: Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker — 
#Fm1-2: also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier —and to the church that meets in your home: 
#Fm1-3: Grace and peace to you "from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
#Fm1-4: I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, 
#Fm1-5: because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus. 
#Fm1-6: I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ. 
#Fm1-7: Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord's people. 
#Fm1-8: Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, 
#Fm1-9: yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul —an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus — 
#Fm1-10: that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, "who became my son while I was in chains. 
#Fm1-11: Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me. 
#Fm1-12: I am sending him —who is my very heart —back to you. 
#Fm1-13: I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. 
#Fm1-14: But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. 
#Fm1-15: Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever — 
#Fm1-16: no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord. 
#Fm1-17: So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. 
#Fm1-18: If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. 
#Fm1-19: I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back —not to mention that you owe me your very self. 
#Fm1-20: I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 
#Fm1-21: Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. 
#Fm1-22: And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. 
#Fm1-23: Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. 
#Fm1-24: And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers. 
#Fm1-25: The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
HEBREUS
 HEBREUS 1
#Hb1-1: In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, 
#Hb1-2: but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe. 
#Hb1-3: The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. 
#Hb1-4: So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs. 
#Hb1-5: For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father" "? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son" "? 
#Hb1-6: And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him." [^3] 
#Hb1-7: In speaking of the angels he says, "He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire." [^4] 
#Hb1-8: But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. 
#Hb1-9: You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy." [^5] 
#Hb1-10: He also says, "In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. 
#Hb1-11: They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. 
#Hb1-12: You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end." [^6] 
#Hb1-13: To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet" "? 
#Hb1-14: Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
 HEBREUS 2
#Hb2-1: We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. 
#Hb2-2: For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, 
#Hb2-3: how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. 
#Hb2-4: God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. 
#Hb2-5: It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. 
#Hb2-6: But there is a place where someone has testified: "What is mankind that you are mindful of them, a son of man that you care for him? 
#Hb2-7: You made them a little "lower than the angels; you crowned them with glory and honor 
#Hb2-8: and put everything under their feet." ""In putting everything under them, "God left nothing that is not subject to them. "Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them. [^6] 
#Hb2-9: But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. 
#Hb2-10: In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered. 
#Hb2-11: Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters. [^7] 
#Hb2-12: He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises." [^8] 
#Hb2-13: And again, "I will put my trust in him." "And again he says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me." [^10] 
#Hb2-14: Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death —that is, the devil — 
#Hb2-15: and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. 
#Hb2-16: For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants. 
#Hb2-17: For this reason he had to be made like them, "fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. 
#Hb2-18: Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
 HEBREUS 3
#Hb3-1: Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest. 
#Hb3-2: He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house. 
#Hb3-3: Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. 
#Hb3-4: For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. 
#Hb3-5: "Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house," "bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future. 
#Hb3-6: But Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory. 
#Hb3-7: So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you hear his voice, 
#Hb3-8: do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the wilderness, 
#Hb3-9: where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did. 
#Hb3-10: That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.' 
#Hb3-11: So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.' " [^2] 
#Hb3-12: See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. 
#Hb3-13: But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "Today," so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. 
#Hb3-14: We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end. 
#Hb3-15: As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion." [^3] 
#Hb3-16: Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? 
#Hb3-17: And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness? 
#Hb3-18: And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed? 
#Hb3-19: So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.
 HEBREUS 4
#Hb4-1: Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. 
#Hb4-2: For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed. [^1] 
#Hb4-3: Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'" "And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world. 
#Hb4-4: For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "On the seventh day God rested from all his works." [^3] 
#Hb4-5: And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest." 
#Hb4-6: Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience, 
#Hb4-7: God again set a certain day, calling it "Today." This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts." [^4] 
#Hb4-8: For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. 
#Hb4-9: There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; 
#Hb4-10: for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works, "just as God did from his. 
#Hb4-11: Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience. 
#Hb4-12: For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. 
#Hb4-13: Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account. 
#Hb4-14: Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, "Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 
#Hb4-15: For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are —yet he did not sin. 
#Hb4-16: Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
 HEBREUS 5
#Hb5-1: Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
#Hb5-2: He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. 
#Hb5-3: This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. 
#Hb5-4: And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was. 
#Hb5-5: In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father." [^1] 
#Hb5-6: And he says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek." [^2] 
#Hb5-7: During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. 
#Hb5-8: Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered 
#Hb5-9: and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him 
#Hb5-10: and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek. 
#Hb5-11: We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand. 
#Hb5-12: In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! 
#Hb5-13: Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. 
#Hb5-14: But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
 HEBREUS 6
#Hb6-1: Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, "and of faith in God, 
#Hb6-2: instruction about cleansing rites, "the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 
#Hb6-3: And God permitting, we will do so. 
#Hb6-4: It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, 
#Hb6-5: who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age 
#Hb6-6: and who have fallen "away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace. 
#Hb6-7: Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God. 
#Hb6-8: But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned. 
#Hb6-9: Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case —the things that have to do with salvation. 
#Hb6-10: God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them. 
#Hb6-11: We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized. 
#Hb6-12: We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised. 
#Hb6-13: When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, 
#Hb6-14: saying, "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants." [^4] 
#Hb6-15: And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised. 
#Hb6-16: People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. 
#Hb6-17: Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. 
#Hb6-18: God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged. 
#Hb6-19: We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, 
#Hb6-20: where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
 HEBREUS 7
#Hb7-1: This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him, 
#Hb7-2: and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means "king of righteousness"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace." 
#Hb7-3: Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever. 
#Hb7-4: Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! 
#Hb7-5: Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people —that is, from their fellow Israelites —even though they also are descended from Abraham. 
#Hb7-6: This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. 
#Hb7-7: And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater. 
#Hb7-8: In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living. 
#Hb7-9: One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham, 
#Hb7-10: because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor. 
#Hb7-11: If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood —and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood —why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? 
#Hb7-12: For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also. 
#Hb7-13: He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar. 
#Hb7-14: For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. 
#Hb7-15: And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, 
#Hb7-16: one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life. 
#Hb7-17: For it is declared: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek." [^1] 
#Hb7-18: The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless 
#Hb7-19: (for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God. 
#Hb7-20: And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath, 
#Hb7-21: but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'" [^2] 
#Hb7-22: Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant. 
#Hb7-23: Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; 
#Hb7-24: but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. 
#Hb7-25: Therefore he is able to save completely "those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. 
#Hb7-26: Such a high priest truly meets our need —one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. 
#Hb7-27: Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. 
#Hb7-28: For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
 HEBREUS 8
#Hb8-1: Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, 
#Hb8-2: and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being. 
#Hb8-3: Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. 
#Hb8-4: If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. 
#Hb8-5: They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: "See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain." [^1] 
#Hb8-6: But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises. 
#Hb8-7: For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. 
#Hb8-8: But God found fault with the people and said ": "The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. 
#Hb8-9: It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord. 
#Hb8-10: This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
#Hb8-11: No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. 
#Hb8-12: For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more." [^3] 
#Hb8-13: By calling this covenant "new," he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.
 HEBREUS 9
#Hb9-1: Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. 
#Hb9-2: A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. 
#Hb9-3: Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, 
#Hb9-4: which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. 
#Hb9-5: Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. 
#Hb9-6: When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. 
#Hb9-7: But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. 
#Hb9-8: The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning. 
#Hb9-9: This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. 
#Hb9-10: They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings —external regulations applying until the time of the new order. 
#Hb9-11: But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, "he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation. 
#Hb9-12: He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining "eternal redemption. 
#Hb9-13: The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. 
#Hb9-14: How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, "so that we may serve the living God! 
#Hb9-15: For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance —now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant. 
#Hb9-16: In the case of a will, "it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, 
#Hb9-17: because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living. 
#Hb9-18: This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. 
#Hb9-19: When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. 
#Hb9-20: He said, "This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep." [^5] 
#Hb9-21: In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. 
#Hb9-22: In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 
#Hb9-23: It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
#Hb9-24: For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence. 
#Hb9-25: Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. 
#Hb9-26: Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
#Hb9-27: Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, 
#Hb9-28: so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
 HEBREUS 10
#Hb10-1: The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming —not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. 
#Hb10-2: Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. 
#Hb10-3: But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins. 
#Hb10-4: It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
#Hb10-5: Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; 
#Hb10-6: with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. 
#Hb10-7: Then I said, 'Here I am —it is written about me in the scroll — I have come to do your will, my God.'" [^1] 
#Hb10-8: First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" —though they were offered in accordance with the law. 
#Hb10-9: Then he said, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He sets aside the first to establish the second. 
#Hb10-10: And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 
#Hb10-11: Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 
#Hb10-12: But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, 
#Hb10-13: and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool. 
#Hb10-14: For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. 
#Hb10-15: The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: 
#Hb10-16: "This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds." [^2] 
#Hb10-17: Then he adds: "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more." [^3] 
#Hb10-18: And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary. 
#Hb10-19: Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, 
#Hb10-20: by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, 
#Hb10-21: and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 
#Hb10-22: let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. 
#Hb10-23: Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. 
#Hb10-24: And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, 
#Hb10-25: not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another —and all the more as you see the Day approaching. 
#Hb10-26: If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, 
#Hb10-27: but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. 
#Hb10-28: Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
#Hb10-29: How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? 
#Hb10-30: For we know him who said, "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," "and again, "The Lord will judge his people." [^5] 
#Hb10-31: It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 
#Hb10-32: Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering. 
#Hb10-33: Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. 
#Hb10-34: You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. 
#Hb10-35: So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. 
#Hb10-36: You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. 
#Hb10-37: For, "In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay." [^6] 
#Hb10-38: And, "But my righteous "one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back." [^8] 
#Hb10-39: But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.
 HEBREUS 11
#Hb11-1: Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. 
#Hb11-2: This is what the ancients were commended for. 
#Hb11-3: By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. 
#Hb11-4: By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead. 
#Hb11-5: By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: "He could not be found, because God had taken him away." "For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. 
#Hb11-6: And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. 
#Hb11-7: By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith. 
#Hb11-8: By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. 
#Hb11-9: By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. 
#Hb11-10: For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 
#Hb11-11: And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she "considered him faithful who had made the promise. 
#Hb11-12: And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. 
#Hb11-13: All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. 
#Hb11-14: People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. 
#Hb11-15: If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. 
#Hb11-16: Instead, they were longing for a better country —a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. 
#Hb11-17: By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, 
#Hb11-18: even though God had said to him, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned." [^3] 
#Hb11-19: Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death. 
#Hb11-20: By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. 
#Hb11-21: By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. 
#Hb11-22: By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones. 
#Hb11-23: By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. 
#Hb11-24: By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. 
#Hb11-25: He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. 
#Hb11-26: He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. 
#Hb11-27: By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. 
#Hb11-28: By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. 
#Hb11-29: By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. 
#Hb11-30: By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for seven days. 
#Hb11-31: By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. [^4] 
#Hb11-32: And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets, 
#Hb11-33: who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, 
#Hb11-34: quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. 
#Hb11-35: Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection. 
#Hb11-36: Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. 
#Hb11-37: They were put to death by stoning; "they were sawed in two; they were killed by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated — 
#Hb11-38: the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and in holes in the ground. 
#Hb11-39: These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised, 
#Hb11-40: since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.
 HEBREUS 12
#Hb12-1: Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, 
#Hb12-2: fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
#Hb12-3: Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. 
#Hb12-4: In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 
#Hb12-5: And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son? It says, "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you, 
#Hb12-6: because the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son." [^1] 
#Hb12-7: Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? 
#Hb12-8: If you are not disciplined —and everyone undergoes discipline —then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. 
#Hb12-9: Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live! 
#Hb12-10: They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. 
#Hb12-11: No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. 
#Hb12-12: Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. 
#Hb12-13: "Make level paths for your feet," "so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed. 
#Hb12-14: Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. 
#Hb12-15: See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many. 
#Hb12-16: See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son. 
#Hb12-17: Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done. 
#Hb12-18: You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm; 
#Hb12-19: to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them, 
#Hb12-20: because they could not bear what was commanded: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death." [^3] 
#Hb12-21: The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear." [^4] 
#Hb12-22: But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, 
#Hb12-23: to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, 
#Hb12-24: to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. 
#Hb12-25: See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven? 
#Hb12-26: At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens." [^5] 
#Hb12-27: The words "once more" indicate the removing of what can be shaken —that is, created things —so that what cannot be shaken may remain. 
#Hb12-28: Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, 
#Hb12-29: for our "God is a consuming fire." [^6]
 HEBREUS 13
#Hb13-1: Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters. 
#Hb13-2: Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. 
#Hb13-3: Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering. 
#Hb13-4: Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. 
#Hb13-5: Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you." [^1] 
#Hb13-6: So we say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?" [^2] 
#Hb13-7: Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. 
#Hb13-8: Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. 
#Hb13-9: Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of no benefit to those who do so. 
#Hb13-10: We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat. 
#Hb13-11: The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp. 
#Hb13-12: And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood. 
#Hb13-13: Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore. 
#Hb13-14: For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come. 
#Hb13-15: Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise —the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. 
#Hb13-16: And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased. 
#Hb13-17: Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you. 
#Hb13-18: Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way. 
#Hb13-19: I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon. 
#Hb13-20: Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, 
#Hb13-21: equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
#Hb13-22: Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you quite briefly. 
#Hb13-23: I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you. 
#Hb13-24: Greet all your leaders and all the Lord's people. Those from Italy send you their greetings. 
#Hb13-25: Grace be with you all.
TIAGO
 TIAGO 1
#Tg1-1: James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings. 
#Tg1-2: Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, "whenever you face trials of many kinds, 
#Tg1-3: because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. 
#Tg1-4: Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. 
#Tg1-5: If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. 
#Tg1-6: But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 
#Tg1-7: That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. 
#Tg1-8: Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do. 
#Tg1-9: Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position. 
#Tg1-10: But the rich should take pride in their humiliation —since they will pass away like a wild flower. 
#Tg1-11: For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business. 
#Tg1-12: Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him. 
#Tg1-13: When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; 
#Tg1-14: but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. 
#Tg1-15: Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. 
#Tg1-16: Don't be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters. 
#Tg1-17: Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. 
#Tg1-18: He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. 
#Tg1-19: My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, 
#Tg1-20: because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. 
#Tg1-21: Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. 
#Tg1-22: Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 
#Tg1-23: Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror 
#Tg1-24: and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 
#Tg1-25: But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it —not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it —they will be blessed in what they do. 
#Tg1-26: Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. 
#Tg1-27: Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
 TIAGO 2
#Tg2-1: My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism. 
#Tg2-2: Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in. 
#Tg2-3: If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet," 
#Tg2-4: have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? 
#Tg2-5: Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? 
#Tg2-6: But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? 
#Tg2-7: Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong? 
#Tg2-8: If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," "you are doing right. 
#Tg2-9: But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. 
#Tg2-10: For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. 
#Tg2-11: For he who said, "You shall not commit adultery," "also said, "You shall not murder." "If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker. 
#Tg2-12: Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, 
#Tg2-13: because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment. 
#Tg2-14: What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? 
#Tg2-15: Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. 
#Tg2-16: If one of you says to them, "Go in peace; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? 
#Tg2-17: In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. 
#Tg2-18: But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. 
#Tg2-19: You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that —and shudder. 
#Tg2-20: You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless "? 
#Tg2-21: Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 
#Tg2-22: You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 
#Tg2-23: And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," "and he was called God's friend. 
#Tg2-24: You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone. 
#Tg2-25: In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? 
#Tg2-26: As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
 TIAGO 3
#Tg3-1: Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. 
#Tg3-2: We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check. 
#Tg3-3: When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. 
#Tg3-4: Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. 
#Tg3-5: Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. 
#Tg3-6: The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one's life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. 
#Tg3-7: All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind, 
#Tg3-8: but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 
#Tg3-9: With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in God's likeness. 
#Tg3-10: Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be. 
#Tg3-11: Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? 
#Tg3-12: My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water. 
#Tg3-13: Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom. 
#Tg3-14: But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. 
#Tg3-15: Such "wisdom" does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
#Tg3-16: For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice. 
#Tg3-17: But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere. 
#Tg3-18: Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.
 TIAGO 4
#Tg4-1: What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? 
#Tg4-2: You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. 
#Tg4-3: When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. 
#Tg4-4: You adulterous people, "don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. 
#Tg4-5: Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us "? 
#Tg4-6: But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble." [^3] 
#Tg4-7: Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
#Tg4-8: Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 
#Tg4-9: Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. 
#Tg4-10: Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. 
#Tg4-11: Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister "or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it. 
#Tg4-12: There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you —who are you to judge your neighbor? 
#Tg4-13: Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money." 
#Tg4-14: Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. 
#Tg4-15: Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that." 
#Tg4-16: As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil. 
#Tg4-17: If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it is sin for them.
 TIAGO 5
#Tg5-1: Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you. 
#Tg5-2: Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. 
#Tg5-3: Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. 
#Tg5-4: Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. 
#Tg5-5: You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. [^1] 
#Tg5-6: You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you. 
#Tg5-7: Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. 
#Tg5-8: You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near. 
#Tg5-9: Don't grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door! 
#Tg5-10: Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
#Tg5-11: As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy. 
#Tg5-12: Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear —not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple "Yes" or "No." Otherwise you will be condemned. 
#Tg5-13: Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. 
#Tg5-14: Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. 
#Tg5-15: And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. 
#Tg5-16: Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. 
#Tg5-17: Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years. 
#Tg5-18: Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops. 
#Tg5-19: My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, 
#Tg5-20: remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
1 PEDRO
 1 PEDRO 1
#1 Pe1-1: Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God's elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, 
#1 Pe1-2: who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance. 
#1 Pe1-3: Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
#1 Pe1-4: and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you, 
#1 Pe1-5: who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. 
#1 Pe1-6: In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 
#1 Pe1-7: These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith —of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire —may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. 
#1 Pe1-8: Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, 
#1 Pe1-9: for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls. 
#1 Pe1-10: Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, 
#1 Pe1-11: trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow. 
#1 Pe1-12: It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things. 
#1 Pe1-13: Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming. 
#1 Pe1-14: As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. 
#1 Pe1-15: But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; 
#1 Pe1-16: for it is written: "Be holy, because I am holy." [^1] 
#1 Pe1-17: Since you call on a Father who judges each person's work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear. 
#1 Pe1-18: For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors, 
#1 Pe1-19: but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. 
#1 Pe1-20: He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. 
#1 Pe1-21: Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God. 
#1 Pe1-22: Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart. [^2] 
#1 Pe1-23: For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. 
#1 Pe1-24: For, "All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall, 
#1 Pe1-25: but the word of the Lord endures forever." "And this is the word that was preached to you.
 1 PEDRO 2
#1 Pe2-1: Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. 
#1 Pe2-2: Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, 
#1 Pe2-3: now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. 
#1 Pe2-4: As you come to him, the living Stone —rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him — 
#1 Pe2-5: you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house "to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
#1 Pe2-6: For in Scripture it says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame." [^2] 
#1 Pe2-7: Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone," [^3] 
#1 Pe2-8: and, "A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall." "They stumble because they disobey the message —which is also what they were destined for. 
#1 Pe2-9: But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. 
#1 Pe2-10: Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. 
#1 Pe2-11: Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. 
#1 Pe2-12: Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. 
#1 Pe2-13: Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, 
#1 Pe2-14: or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 
#1 Pe2-15: For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. 
#1 Pe2-16: Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God's slaves. 
#1 Pe2-17: Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor. 
#1 Pe2-18: Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. 
#1 Pe2-19: For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God. 
#1 Pe2-20: But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. 
#1 Pe2-21: To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. 
#1 Pe2-22: "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth." [^5] 
#1 Pe2-23: When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. 
#1 Pe2-24: "He himself bore our sins" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed." 
#1 Pe2-25: For "you were like sheep going astray," "but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
 1 PEDRO 3
#1 Pe3-1: Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, 
#1 Pe3-2: when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. 
#1 Pe3-3: Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. 
#1 Pe3-4: Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. 
#1 Pe3-5: For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, 
#1 Pe3-6: like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear. 
#1 Pe3-7: Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. 
#1 Pe3-8: Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. 
#1 Pe3-9: Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. 
#1 Pe3-10: For, "Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech. 
#1 Pe3-11: They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it. 
#1 Pe3-12: For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil." [^1] 
#1 Pe3-13: Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? 
#1 Pe3-14: But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear their threats "; do not be frightened." [^3] 
#1 Pe3-15: But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 
#1 Pe3-16: keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. 
#1 Pe3-17: For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. 
#1 Pe3-18: For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. 
#1 Pe3-19: After being made alive, "he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits — 
#1 Pe3-20: to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 
#1 Pe3-21: and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also —not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. "It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
#1 Pe3-22: who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand —with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.
 1 PEDRO 4
#1 Pe4-1: Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin. 
#1 Pe4-2: As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. 
#1 Pe4-3: For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do —living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. 
#1 Pe4-4: They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you. 
#1 Pe4-5: But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
#1 Pe4-6: For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit. 
#1 Pe4-7: The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray. 
#1 Pe4-8: Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. 
#1 Pe4-9: Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. 
#1 Pe4-10: Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms. 
#1 Pe4-11: If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen. 
#1 Pe4-12: Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 
#1 Pe4-13: But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 
#1 Pe4-14: If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. 
#1 Pe4-15: If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. 
#1 Pe4-16: However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name. 
#1 Pe4-17: For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? 
#1 Pe4-18: And, "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?" [^1] 
#1 Pe4-19: So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.
 1 PEDRO 5
#1 Pe5-1: To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ's sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed: 
#1 Pe5-2: Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, watching over them —not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; 
#1 Pe5-3: not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. 
#1 Pe5-4: And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away. 
#1 Pe5-5: In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble." [^1] 
#1 Pe5-6: Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. 
#1 Pe5-7: Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. 
#1 Pe5-8: Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. 
#1 Pe5-9: Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings. 
#1 Pe5-10: And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. 
#1 Pe5-11: To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen. 
#1 Pe5-12: With the help of Silas, "whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it. 
#1 Pe5-13: She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark. 
#1 Pe5-14: Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
2 PEDRO
 2 PEDRO 1
#2 Pe1-1: Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours: 
#2 Pe1-2: Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. 
#2 Pe1-3: His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. 
#2 Pe1-4: Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. 
#2 Pe1-5: For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; 
#2 Pe1-6: and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; 
#2 Pe1-7: and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. 
#2 Pe1-8: For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#2 Pe1-9: But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins. 
#2 Pe1-10: Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall, 
#2 Pe1-11: and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
#2 Pe1-12: So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have. 
#2 Pe1-13: I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body, 
#2 Pe1-14: because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. 
#2 Pe1-15: And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things. 
#2 Pe1-16: We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
#2 Pe1-17: For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." 
#2 Pe1-18: We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. 
#2 Pe1-19: And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 
#2 Pe1-20: Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation. 
#2 Pe1-21: For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
 2 PEDRO 2
#2 Pe2-1: But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them —bringing swift destruction on themselves. 
#2 Pe2-2: Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 
#2 Pe2-3: In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping. 
#2 Pe2-4: For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, "putting them in chains of darkness "to be held for judgment; 
#2 Pe2-5: if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; 
#2 Pe2-6: if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; 
#2 Pe2-7: and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless 
#2 Pe2-8: (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard) — 
#2 Pe2-9: if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment. 
#2 Pe2-10: This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh "and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings; 
#2 Pe2-11: yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from "the Lord. 
#2 Pe2-12: But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish. 
#2 Pe2-13: They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you. [^5] 
#2 Pe2-14: With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed —an accursed brood! 
#2 Pe2-15: They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer, "who loved the wages of wickedness. 
#2 Pe2-16: But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey —an animal without speech —who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's madness. 
#2 Pe2-17: These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. 
#2 Pe2-18: For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error. 
#2 Pe2-19: They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity —for "people are slaves to whatever has mastered them." 
#2 Pe2-20: If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. 
#2 Pe2-21: It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. 
#2 Pe2-22: Of them the proverbs are true: "A dog returns to its vomit," "and, "A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud."
 2 PEDRO 3
#2 Pe3-1: Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking. 
#2 Pe3-2: I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles. 
#2 Pe3-3: Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 
#2 Pe3-4: They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation." 
#2 Pe3-5: But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. 
#2 Pe3-6: By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 
#2 Pe3-7: By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly. 
#2 Pe3-8: But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. 
#2 Pe3-9: The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. 
#2 Pe3-10: But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare. [^1] 
#2 Pe3-11: Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives 
#2 Pe3-12: as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. "That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. 
#2 Pe3-13: But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells. 
#2 Pe3-14: So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him. 
#2 Pe3-15: Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. 
#2 Pe3-16: He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. 
#2 Pe3-17: Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position. 
#2 Pe3-18: But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.

#1 Jo2-4: Whoever says, "I know him," but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person.

#1 Jo2-6: Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.

#1 Jo2-17: The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever. 
#1 Jo2-18: Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. 
#1 Jo2-19: They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. 
#1 Jo2-20: But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. [^5] 
#1 Jo2-21: I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. 
#1 Jo2-22: Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist —denying the Father and the Son. 
#1 Jo2-23: No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.

 1 JOÃO 3
#1 Jo3-1: See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 
#1 Jo3-2: Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, "we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.

#1 Jo3-5: But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. 
#1 Jo3-6: No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him. 
#1 Jo3-7: Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. 
#1 Jo3-8: The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work. 
#1 Jo3-9: No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. 
#1 Jo3-10: This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God's child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister. 
#1 Jo3-11: For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another. 
#1 Jo3-12: Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous.

#1 Jo3-17: If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? 
#1 Jo3-18: Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.

#1 Jo3-20: If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 
#1 Jo3-21: Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God 
#1 Jo3-22: and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him.

 1 JOÃO 4
#1 Jo4-1: Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
#1 Jo4-2: This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 
#1 Jo4-3: but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. 
#1 Jo4-4: You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 
#1 Jo4-5: They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 
#1 Jo4-6: We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit "of truth and the spirit of falsehood. 
#1 Jo4-7: Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 
#1 Jo4-8: Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
#1 Jo4-9: This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 
#1 Jo4-10: This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 
#1 Jo4-11: Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
#1 Jo4-12: No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 
#1 Jo4-13: This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 
#1 Jo4-14: And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 
#1 Jo4-15: If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 
#1 Jo4-16: And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. 
#1 Jo4-17: This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. 
#1 Jo4-18: There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 
#1 Jo4-19: We love because he first loved us. 
#1 Jo4-20: Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. 
#1 Jo4-21: And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.
 1 JOÃO 5
#1 Jo5-1: Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. 
#1 Jo5-2: This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. 
#1 Jo5-3: In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, 
#1 Jo5-4: for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. 
#1 Jo5-5: Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 
#1 Jo5-6: This is the one who came by water and blood —Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 
#1 Jo5-7: For there are three that testify: 
#1 Jo5-8: the "Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. 
#1 Jo5-9: We accept human testimony, but God's testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. 
#1 Jo5-10: Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. 
#1 Jo5-11: And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
#1 Jo5-12: Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 
#1 Jo5-13: I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 
#1 Jo5-14: This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 
#1 Jo5-15: And if we know that he hears us —whatever we ask —we know that we have what we asked of him. 
#1 Jo5-16: If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. 
#1 Jo5-17: All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death. 
#1 Jo5-18: We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 
#1 Jo5-19: We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 
#1 Jo5-20: We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 
#1 Jo5-21: Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.

#2 Jo1-4: It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us. 
#2 Jo1-5: And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another. 
#2 Jo1-6: And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love. 
#2 Jo1-7: I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. 
#2 Jo1-8: Watch out that you do not lose what we "have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully. 
#2 Jo1-9: Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 
#2 Jo1-10: If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. 
#2 Jo1-11: Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work. 
#2 Jo1-12: I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.

#3 Jo1-2: Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well. 
#3 Jo1-3: It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it.

#3 Jo1-5: Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters, "even though they are strangers to you. 
#3 Jo1-6: They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God.

#3 Jo1-8: We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth. 
#3 Jo1-9: I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us. 
#3 Jo1-10: So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church. 
#3 Jo1-11: Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.

#Jd1-1: Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for "Jesus Christ: 
#Jd1-2: Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance. 
#Jd1-3: Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people. 
#Jd1-4: For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about "long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord. 
#Jd1-5: Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord "at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe. 
#Jd1-6: And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling —these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day. 
#Jd1-7: In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. 
#Jd1-8: In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings. 
#Jd1-9: But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, "The Lord rebuke you!" [^4] 
#Jd1-10: Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct —as irrational animals do —will destroy them. 
#Jd1-11: Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion. 
#Jd1-12: These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm —shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted —twice dead. 
#Jd1-13: They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever. 
#Jd1-14: Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: "See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones 
#Jd1-15: to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him." [^5] 
#Jd1-16: These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage. 
#Jd1-17: But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. 
#Jd1-18: They said to you, "In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires." 
#Jd1-19: These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit. 
#Jd1-20: But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, 
#Jd1-21: keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. 
#Jd1-22: Be merciful to those who doubt; 
#Jd1-23: save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear —hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh. [^6] 
#Jd1-24: To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy —

 APOCALIPSE 1

#Ap1-2: who testifies to everything he saw —that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
#Ap1-3: Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near. 
#Ap1-4: John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits "before his throne, 
#Ap1-5: and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,

#Ap1-12: I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, 
#Ap1-13: and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, "dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 
#Ap1-14: The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 
#Ap1-15: His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. 
#Ap1-16: In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance. 
#Ap1-17: When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. 
#Ap1-18: I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades. 
#Ap1-19: "Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later. 
#Ap1-20: The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels "of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
 APOCALIPSE 2
#Ap2-1: "To the angel "of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands. 
#Ap2-2: I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false. 
#Ap2-3: You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary. 
#Ap2-4: Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first. 
#Ap2-5: Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place. 
#Ap2-6: But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
#Ap2-7: Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God. 
#Ap2-8: "To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again. 
#Ap2-9: I know your afflictions and your poverty —yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. 
#Ap2-10: Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor's crown. 
#Ap2-11: Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death. 
#Ap2-12: "To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword. 
#Ap2-13: I know where you live —where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city —where Satan lives. 
#Ap2-14: Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality. 
#Ap2-15: Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 
#Ap2-16: Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. 
#Ap2-17: Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it. 
#Ap2-18: "To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze. 
#Ap2-19: I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first. 
#Ap2-20: Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. 
#Ap2-21: I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling. 
#Ap2-22: So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways. 
#Ap2-23: I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds. 
#Ap2-24: Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets, 'I will not impose any other burden on you, 
#Ap2-25: except to hold on to what you have until I come.' 
#Ap2-26: To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations — 
#Ap2-27: that one 'will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery' "—just as I have received authority from my Father. 
#Ap2-28: I will also give that one the morning star. 
#Ap2-29: Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
 APOCALIPSE 3
#Ap3-1: "To the angel "of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits "of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead. 
#Ap3-2: Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God. 
#Ap3-3: Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you. 
#Ap3-4: Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy. 
#Ap3-5: The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels. 
#Ap3-6: Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. 
#Ap3-7: "To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. 
#Ap3-8: I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. 
#Ap3-9: I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars —I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. 
#Ap3-10: Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth. 
#Ap3-11: I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown. 
#Ap3-12: The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name. 
#Ap3-13: Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. 
#Ap3-14: "To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God's creation. 
#Ap3-15: I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! 
#Ap3-16: So, because you are lukewarm —neither hot nor cold —I am about to spit you out of my mouth. 
#Ap3-17: You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. 
#Ap3-18: I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see. 
#Ap3-19: Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent. 
#Ap3-20: Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. 
#Ap3-21: To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne. 
#Ap3-22: Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
 APOCALIPSE 4
#Ap4-1: After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this." 
#Ap4-2: At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. 
#Ap4-3: And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne. 
#Ap4-4: Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads. 
#Ap4-5: From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits "of God. 
#Ap4-6: Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. 
#Ap4-7: The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. 
#Ap4-8: Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: "'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,' "who was, and is, and is to come." 
#Ap4-9: Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, 
#Ap4-10: the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say: 
#Ap4-11: "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."
 APOCALIPSE 5
#Ap5-1: Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. 
#Ap5-2: And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, "Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?" 
#Ap5-3: But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. 
#Ap5-4: I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. 
#Ap5-5: Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals." 
#Ap5-6: Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits "of God sent out into all the earth. 
#Ap5-7: He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne. 
#Ap5-8: And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God's people. 
#Ap5-9: And they sang a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. 
#Ap5-10: You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign "on the earth." 
#Ap5-11: Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. 
#Ap5-12: In a loud voice they were saying: "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!" 
#Ap5-13: Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!" 
#Ap5-14: The four living creatures said, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.
 APOCALIPSE 6
#Ap6-1: I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, "Come!" 
#Ap6-2: I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. 
#Ap6-3: When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!" 
#Ap6-4: Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword. 
#Ap6-5: When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. 
#Ap6-6: Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, "Two pounds "of wheat for a day's wages, "and six pounds "of barley for a day's wages, "and do not damage the oil and the wine!" 
#Ap6-7: When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!" 
#Ap6-8: I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth. 
#Ap6-9: When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 
#Ap6-10: They called out in a loud voice, "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?" 
#Ap6-11: Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters, "were killed just as they had been. 
#Ap6-12: I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, 
#Ap6-13: and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. 
#Ap6-14: The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. 
#Ap6-15: Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. 
#Ap6-16: They called to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us "from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! 
#Ap6-17: For the great day of their "wrath has come, and who can withstand it?"
 APOCALIPSE 7
#Ap7-1: After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. 
#Ap7-2: Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: 
#Ap7-3: "Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God." 
#Ap7-4: Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel. 
#Ap7-5: From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000, 
#Ap7-6: from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000, 
#Ap7-7: from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000, 
#Ap7-8: from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000. 
#Ap7-9: After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. 
#Ap7-10: And they cried out in a loud voice: "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb." 
#Ap7-11: All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
#Ap7-12: saying: "Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!" 
#Ap7-13: Then one of the elders asked me, "These in white robes —who are they, and where did they come from?" 
#Ap7-14: I answered, "Sir, you know." And he said, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
#Ap7-15: Therefore, "they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence. 
#Ap7-16: 'Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them,' "nor any scorching heat. 
#Ap7-17: For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; 'he will lead them to springs of living water.' "'And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.' ""
 APOCALIPSE 8
#Ap8-1: When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
#Ap8-2: And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 
#Ap8-3: Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all God's people, on the golden altar in front of the throne. 
#Ap8-4: The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God's people, went up before God from the angel's hand. 
#Ap8-5: Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake. 
#Ap8-6: Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them. 
#Ap8-7: The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. 
#Ap8-8: The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 
#Ap8-9: a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. 
#Ap8-10: The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water — 
#Ap8-11: the name of the star is Wormwood. "A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter. 
#Ap8-12: The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night. 
#Ap8-13: As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: "Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!"
 APOCALIPSE 9
#Ap9-1: The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. 
#Ap9-2: When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 
#Ap9-3: And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. 
#Ap9-4: They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 
#Ap9-5: They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes. 
#Ap9-6: During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them. 
#Ap9-7: The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. 
#Ap9-8: Their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth. 
#Ap9-9: They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. 
#Ap9-10: They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months. 
#Ap9-11: They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer). 
#Ap9-12: The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come. 
#Ap9-13: The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God. 
#Ap9-14: It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates." 
#Ap9-15: And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind. 
#Ap9-16: The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number. 
#Ap9-17: The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur. 
#Ap9-18: A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths. 
#Ap9-19: The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury. 
#Ap9-20: The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood —idols that cannot see or hear or walk. 
#Ap9-21: Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.
 APOCALIPSE 10
#Ap10-1: Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars. 
#Ap10-2: He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, 
#Ap10-3: and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke. 
#Ap10-4: And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down." 
#Ap10-5: Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven. 
#Ap10-6: And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, "There will be no more delay! 
#Ap10-7: But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets." 
#Ap10-8: Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: "Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land." 
#Ap10-9: So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, "Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but 'in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.' "" 
#Ap10-10: I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour. 
#Ap10-11: Then I was told, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings."
 APOCALIPSE 11
#Ap11-1: I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, "Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers. 
#Ap11-2: But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months. 
#Ap11-3: And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth." 
#Ap11-4: They are "the two olive trees" and the two lampstands, and "they stand before the Lord of the earth." [^1] 
#Ap11-5: If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. 
#Ap11-6: They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want. 
#Ap11-7: Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them. 
#Ap11-8: Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city —which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt —where also their Lord was crucified. 
#Ap11-9: For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. 
#Ap11-10: The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth. 
#Ap11-11: But after the three and a half days the breath "of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them. 
#Ap11-12: Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on. 
#Ap11-13: At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. 
#Ap11-14: The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon. 
#Ap11-15: The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever." 
#Ap11-16: And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
#Ap11-17: saying: "We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign. 
#Ap11-18: The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small — and for destroying those who destroy the earth." 
#Ap11-19: Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm.
 APOCALIPSE 12
#Ap12-1: A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 
#Ap12-2: She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 
#Ap12-3: Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. 
#Ap12-4: Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. 
#Ap12-5: She gave birth to a son, a male child, who "will rule all the nations with an iron scepter." "And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne. 
#Ap12-6: The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days. 
#Ap12-7: Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 
#Ap12-8: But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 
#Ap12-9: The great dragon was hurled down —that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. 
#Ap12-10: Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. 
#Ap12-11: They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death. 
#Ap12-12: Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short." 
#Ap12-13: When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 
#Ap12-14: The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent's reach. 
#Ap12-15: Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. 
#Ap12-16: But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. 
#Ap12-17: Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring —those who keep God's commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.
 APOCALIPSE 13
#Ap13-1: The dragon "stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. 
#Ap13-2: The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. 
#Ap13-3: One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. 
#Ap13-4: People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, "Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?" 
#Ap13-5: The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months. 
#Ap13-6: It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven. 
#Ap13-7: It was given power to wage war against God's holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. 
#Ap13-8: All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast —all whose names have not been written in the Lamb's book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world. [^2] 
#Ap13-9: Whoever has ears, let them hear. 
#Ap13-10: "If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed "with the sword, with the sword they will be killed." "This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God's people. 
#Ap13-11: Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. 
#Ap13-12: It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 
#Ap13-13: And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 
#Ap13-14: Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. 
#Ap13-15: The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 
#Ap13-16: It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 
#Ap13-17: so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. 
#Ap13-18: This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. "That number is 666.
 APOCALIPSE 14
#Ap14-1: Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. 
#Ap14-2: And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. 
#Ap14-3: And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 
#Ap14-4: These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. 
#Ap14-5: No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless. 
#Ap14-6: Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth —to every nation, tribe, language and people. 
#Ap14-7: He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water." 
#Ap14-8: A second angel followed and said, "'Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,' "which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries." 
#Ap14-9: A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: "If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, 
#Ap14-10: they, too, will drink the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. 
#Ap14-11: And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name." 
#Ap14-12: This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus. 
#Ap14-13: Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them." 
#Ap14-14: I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man "with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 
#Ap14-15: Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, "Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe." 
#Ap14-16: So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. 
#Ap14-17: Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. 
#Ap14-18: Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe." 
#Ap14-19: The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath. 
#Ap14-20: They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia. [^3]
 APOCALIPSE 15
#Ap15-1: I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues —last, because with them God's wrath is completed. 
#Ap15-2: And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name. They held harps given them by God 
#Ap15-3: and sang the song of God's servant Moses and of the Lamb: "Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the nations. [^1] 
#Ap15-4: Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed." [^2] 
#Ap15-5: After this I looked, and I saw in heaven the temple —that is, the tabernacle of the covenant law —and it was opened. 
#Ap15-6: Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests. 
#Ap15-7: Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever. 
#Ap15-8: And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
 APOCALIPSE 16
#Ap16-1: Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, "Go, pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth." 
#Ap16-2: The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. 
#Ap16-3: The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died. 
#Ap16-4: The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. 
#Ap16-5: Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: "You are just in these judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were; 
#Ap16-6: for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve." 
#Ap16-7: And I heard the altar respond: "Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments." 
#Ap16-8: The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire. 
#Ap16-9: They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him. 
#Ap16-10: The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony 
#Ap16-11: and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done. 
#Ap16-12: The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. 
#Ap16-13: Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 
#Ap16-14: They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty. 
#Ap16-15: "Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed." 
#Ap16-16: Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon. 
#Ap16-17: The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, "It is done!" 
#Ap16-18: Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake. 
#Ap16-19: The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath. 
#Ap16-20: Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found. 
#Ap16-21: From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, "fell on people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.
 APOCALIPSE 17
#Ap17-1: One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters. 
#Ap17-2: With her the kings of the earth committed adultery, and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries." 
#Ap17-3: Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. 
#Ap17-4: The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. 
#Ap17-5: The name written on her forehead was a mystery: BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 
#Ap17-6: I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God's holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished. 
#Ap17-7: Then the angel said to me: "Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns. 
#Ap17-8: The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not, and yet will come. 
#Ap17-9: "This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. 
#Ap17-10: They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while. 
#Ap17-11: The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction. 
#Ap17-12: "The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. 
#Ap17-13: They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. 
#Ap17-14: They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings —and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers." 
#Ap17-15: Then the angel said to me, "The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. 
#Ap17-16: The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 
#Ap17-17: For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God's words are fulfilled. 
#Ap17-18: The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth."
 APOCALIPSE 18
#Ap18-1: After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. 
#Ap18-2: With a mighty voice he shouted: "'Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!' "She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal. 
#Ap18-3: For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries." 
#Ap18-4: Then I heard another voice from heaven say: "'Come out of her, my people,' "so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues; 
#Ap18-5: for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. 
#Ap18-6: Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Pour her a double portion from her own cup. 
#Ap18-7: Give her as much torment and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, 'I sit enthroned as queen. I am not a widow; "I will never mourn.' 
#Ap18-8: Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her. 
#Ap18-9: "When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. 
#Ap18-10: Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: "'Woe! Woe to you, great city, you mighty city of Babylon! In one hour your doom has come!' 
#Ap18-11: "The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes anymore — 
#Ap18-12: cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; 
#Ap18-13: cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and human beings sold as slaves. 
#Ap18-14: "They will say, 'The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.' 
#Ap18-15: The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn 
#Ap18-16: and cry out: "'Woe! Woe to you, great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls! 
#Ap18-17: In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' "Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off. 
#Ap18-18: When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, 'Was there ever a city like this great city?' 
#Ap18-19: They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: "'Woe! Woe to you, great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!' 
#Ap18-20: "Rejoice over her, you heavens! Rejoice, you people of God! Rejoice, apostles and prophets! For God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you." 
#Ap18-21: Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: "With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again. 
#Ap18-22: The music of harpists and musicians, pipers and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No worker of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again. 
#Ap18-23: The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's important people. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray. 
#Ap18-24: In her was found the blood of prophets and of God's holy people, of all who have been slaughtered on the earth."
 APOCALIPSE 19
#Ap19-1: After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting: "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, 
#Ap19-2: for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants." 
#Ap19-3: And again they shouted: "Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever." 
#Ap19-4: The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried: "Amen, Hallelujah!" 
#Ap19-5: Then a voice came from the throne, saying: "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both great and small!" 
#Ap19-6: Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: "Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns. 
#Ap19-7: Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready. 
#Ap19-8: Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear." (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God's holy people.) 
#Ap19-9: Then the angel said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!" And he added, "These are the true words of God." 
#Ap19-10: At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus." 
#Ap19-11: I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war. 
#Ap19-12: His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. 
#Ap19-13: He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. 
#Ap19-14: The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. 
#Ap19-15: Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. "He will rule them with an iron scepter." "He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. 
#Ap19-16: On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. 
#Ap19-17: And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, "Come, gather together for the great supper of God, 
#Ap19-18: so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small." 
#Ap19-19: Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army. 
#Ap19-20: But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. 
#Ap19-21: The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
 APOCALIPSE 20
#Ap20-1: And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. 
#Ap20-2: He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. 
#Ap20-3: He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time. 
#Ap20-4: I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They "had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 
#Ap20-5: (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. 
#Ap20-6: Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years. 
#Ap20-7: When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison 
#Ap20-8: and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth —Gog and Magog —and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore. 
#Ap20-9: They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. 
#Ap20-10: And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever. 
#Ap20-11: Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 
#Ap20-12: And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. 
#Ap20-13: The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done. 
#Ap20-14: Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. 
#Ap20-15: Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
 APOCALIPSE 21
#Ap21-1: Then I saw "a new heaven and a new earth," "for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. 
#Ap21-2: I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. 
#Ap21-3: And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. 
#Ap21-4: 'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' "or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." 
#Ap21-5: He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true." 
#Ap21-6: He said to me: "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. 
#Ap21-7: Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children. 
#Ap21-8: But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars —they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death." 
#Ap21-9: One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb." 
#Ap21-10: And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. 
#Ap21-11: It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 
#Ap21-12: It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
#Ap21-13: There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. 
#Ap21-14: The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
#Ap21-15: The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls. 
#Ap21-16: The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia "in length, and as wide and high as it is long. 
#Ap21-17: The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits "thick. [^5] 
#Ap21-18: The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. 
#Ap21-19: The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
#Ap21-20: the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. [^6] 
#Ap21-21: The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass. 
#Ap21-22: I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 
#Ap21-23: The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. 
#Ap21-24: The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. 
#Ap21-25: On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. 
#Ap21-26: The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. 
#Ap21-27: Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
 APOCALIPSE 22
#Ap22-1: Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 
#Ap22-2: down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. 
#Ap22-3: No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. 
#Ap22-4: They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 
#Ap22-5: There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever. 
#Ap22-6: The angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place." 
#Ap22-7: "Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll." 
#Ap22-8: I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me. 
#Ap22-9: But he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God!" 
#Ap22-10: Then he told me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near. 
#Ap22-11: Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy." 
#Ap22-12: "Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done.
